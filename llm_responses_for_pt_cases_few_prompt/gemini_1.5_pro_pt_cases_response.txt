Imaging you are a registered dietitian who sees patient for nutrition counseling sessions and remotely monitoring the patient's blood glucose management. Your job is to come up with a treatment plan to address the high A1C status for the patient based on the subjective information, objective information, and the assessment provided. 

Here are a few examples of the patient cases with subjective information, objective information, assessment and the treatment plan: 
Example 1:Subjective:
Medical hx: T2DM for ~20 years, HTN for ~20 years, HLD. Pt feels that T2DM is generally well controlled.
Relevant social hx: Lives with family
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: Not smoking; drinks once a week, shot of hard liquor
Diet recall: Pt reports follows typical indian diet, three meals a day with dinner usually being the lightest meal. Pt also has tea and cookies/biscuits in the afternoon. Pt is mostly vegetarian has lentils most often for protein, eats vegetables,  diet a bit higher in carbs
Physical activities: Pt reports walking briskly twice daily for at least 30 minutes 

Objective: 
Age: 78
Gender: male
Meds: Jardiance 25 mg 1x/day, Metformin 1000 mg BID, Pioglitazone 45 mg 1x/day
Labs: 8/4/23 - A1C was 9.6%, 3/12/24 A1C was 9.7%.
Home-monitored vitals: Pt has not checked BP or BG recently
Pt doesn't see an Endocrinologist

Assessment:
Pt with uncontrolled DM r/t A1c on 9.7%. Pt has a long history of DM and interventions focused on including more activity after meals and smaller portions of carbohydrates were previously discussed. 

Plan: 
Physical Activities: 
Recommend walking for at least 15 minutes after meals.
Encourage strength training exercises.
Diet Recommendations:
Discuss reducing portions of carbohydrates and pairing them with protein.
Flour Alternatives: Use whole wheat flour instead of white flour for roti/chapati/paratha; use lentil flour (besan/chickpea) instead of white flour.
Vegetable Additions: Add more vegetables to dough/batter when possible.
Snack Foods: Limit/avoid fried snack foods and desserts.
Beverages: For chai, use natural sweeteners (monk fruit, stevia) and low-fat or plant-based milk.
Adding more protein to the diet: add more chutney, greek yogurt
Using brown rice and monitoring portion size
Medication:
Jardiance and metformin seem appropriate. Assess how long the patient has been taking Pioglitazone, consider if a GLP-1 agonist may be better. 
Education:
Educate the patient on the relationship between carbohydrate foods and their effect on blood sugar.
Educate the patient on A1c, its definition and its importance
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Try to get more BG readings during the day: fasting 3 times a week and paired 3 times a week.
Follow up:
Patient to follow up with the provider. Regular follow up with RD.
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
Consider to change BG monitoring schedule to pair reading/pos meal day time BG to help the patient visualize his high A1c, then propose dietary adjustment /strength training
Get an understanding about what the patient eats with meals, the exact amount of carbohydrates patient is consuming, and at what times.
Ask if the patient checks paired glucose levels. Suggest mealtime paired readings to understand which foods are more problematic and the tipping point for carbohydrate intake

Example 2: 
Subjective:
Medical hx: Pt is on insulin and had a history of frequently forgetting taking them
Diet: diet remained the same after counseling (having a big portion of watermelon with oatmeals for breakfast)
Physical activities: 
Patient’s questions, reported knowledge, stated beliefs and attitudes: Pt previously worked with RDs, struggled with controlling portion size of carbs in her meals 

Objective:
Age: 60
Gender: Female
Home-Monitored Vitals: Avg BG 130 mg/dL this month, 185 mg/dL previous month, 277 mg/dL from Jan to Feb
Meds: Humalog and Lantus insulin 100 unit/mL
Medical diagnosis: HTN, HLD, T2DM, Obesity 
Labs: 9.6% A1c in 01/2024
Last PCP visit on 02/23/2024 for her lung issues; no detailed SOAP note on EHR
Pt is using food log feature currently

Assessment:
Overconsumption of carbohydrates d/t lack of nutrition knowledge or low levels of readiness of changes in the past
Completed F/U with RD on 02/15/24, discussed carb sources and controlling portion size, adding proteins and healthy fat sources to meals; pt has made significant progress

Plan:
Physical Activities: 
Encourage physical activities/mobility, remind the patient about the insurance coverage for PT and certain health conditions
Diet Recommendations:
Encourage the patient to always include scrambled eggs and mixed nuts in breakfast, lean protein sources and vegetables in lunch/dinner
Medication:
Remind the patient about insulin and meds compliance
Education:
Educate the patient regarding T2DM, insulin, BG and quality of life (how improving BG is going to benefit her overall quality of life; the importance of health and what does it mean)
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD continue to monitor food logs and blood sugar levels. 
RD could ask the patient how she feels about the feedback on her food log pictures.
RD could work with the patient to make a list of topic that the patient would love to talk about (with different levels of concern/confidence)

Example 3: 
Subjective:
Chief complaints: pain and uncontrolled hyperglycemia
Medical hx: T2DM, HTN, arthritis, nephrolithiasis, CKD Stage 3a, sickle cell trait, dorsalgia/sciatica (L hip pain), spinal stenosis, and BPH. Pt went to ER for hip pain on 3/5/2024, had an Ortho appt on 3/11/2024. 
Surgical hx: Previously rotator cuff sx in March 2024
Occupation/schedule: Pt is a former athlete football player, works for sheriff dept and coaches at highschool, has not been working since March. 
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: No alcohol or smoke
Patient’s questions, reported knowledge, stated beliefs and attitudes: Pt has been unresponsive to the care team but came in to get a new BG device recently and took a BG and a BP reading.  

Objective:
Age: 73
Gender: Male
Weight: 247 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: BP on 4/10/24 was 149/83 mmHg, only one BG reading in the past 90 days and it was 276 mg/dL. Pt had been inactive due to technical issues with home-monitoring devices, difficult to reach by RD. 
Meds: Atenolol 25 mg qd, Losartan 100 mg, Humalog 22 units TID w/meals, Lantus 50 units daily (not taking consistently), Jardiance 25 mg, Ibuprofen 800 mg, Tramadol 50 mg, Prednisone 10 mg BID. 
Last PCP visit on 3/7/24 s/p ER visit r/t pain 
Labs: 9.1% A1c on 2/6/2024; 9.2% A1c on 4/9/2023.

Assessment:
The patient has been responsive recently. Pt is dealing with a lot of pain so hyperglycemia is likely not his number one priority, and it would be difficult for him to be responsive with that much pain. Pt was given a new BG device recently and might be better to reframe goals of his BG management oriented around pain management.

Plan:
Physical Activities: 
Suggest the patient to see a Physical Therapist if he hasn't seen one
Diet Recommendations:
Nutrition to support pain management, suggest the patient to have some go to snacks/meals
Medication:
Discuss the importance of insulin compliance with the patient.
Follow up:
More regular follow ups
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to reach out to the patient again to re-establish communication given new BG device
RD to reframe goals oriented around pain management using motivational interviewing

Example 4: 
Subjective:
Medical hx:  In addition to type 2 DM, patient has diagnosis of depression, unspecified dysphagia, hemiplegia, hypothyroidism, PTSD, dysarthria and anarthria (RD spoke with patient’s daughter for their joint appointments), and COPD. Patient reports having a stroke 2 to 3 years ago and stated she was bedridden for 2 months with a cyst with related weight loss on 4/5/24.
Relevant social hx: Pt's daughter lives with her and helps with her care, but daughter appears easily overwhelmed and has a hard time remembering to test blood sugar and give medications/insulin regularly. Daughter is also in our program for BG monitoring and is fairly noncompliant as well. They have both shown some recent improvement in compliance though, patient more so than her daughter.
Diet: food storage is limited to a mini fridge/freezer and food preparation is limited to a microwave. Patient has started drinking Hint waters instead of soda.
Physical Activities: Patient reports walking two laps around one of the hotel buildings daily and tried increasing to three laps but fell.
Readiness to change: Patient’s stage of change is contemplation. Barriers to change include being technically homeless, currently living in a hotel room in a reportedly unsafe area
Other relevant info reported by pt: Patient reports taking 60 units Basaglar daily and 15 units of lispro twice a day. Patient doesn't trust herself to give herself her own injections when daughter is not there. Patient’s daughter wrote and posted correct insulin dose on fridge for patient.

Objective:
Age: 56
Gender: Female
Height: 5'3""
Weight: 173 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: 30-day BG average is 421 mg/dL as of 6/10/24 based on 12 readings; Out-of-rang BG readings reported on 5/30, 5/28, and 5/27.
Meds: Patient is prescribed 50 units of Basaglar daily and lispro per sliding scale 3 times a day with a 30 unit daily max. 
Labs: A1c trend as of 6/10/24 - trended down from >14% in 2/2023 to 10.7% in 12/2023

Assessment: 
Patient has a h/o routine OOR readings; hard to tell whether patient has more recently improved as far as vitals monitoring regularity, the readings themselves, or both. Main problem to focus on is medication compliance; if patient becomes more compliant to prescribed medication regimen, PCP should be more willing to make any necessary changes. Secondary problem is patient’s lack of access to balanced food choices and limited means to prepare them with. Patient and patient’s daughter have responded well to repeated reminders about patient’s prescribed insulin regimen, ideas on how to remember to give it on a daily basis, and suggestions of unsweetened beverages to try.

Plan:
Goals: 
Improve insulin and BG testing routine
Medication:
Gradually get the patient to use insulin exactly as prescribed.
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Suggest the daughter to check 2 hours post-meal BG for the next couple weeks to see how many insulin the patient actually needs.
Resources Provided:
Share resources on food banks, SNAP (if applicable), and foods requiring little to no cooking/refrigeration
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to get to know the carb amount the patient consumes; ideally to get pre-meal BG readings, post-meal BG readings and food logs.
Takes baby steps with the patient.

Example 5: 
Subjective:
Relevant social hx: Pt lives with wife 
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: Not drinking/smoking
Diet: Wife cooks and mostly eats at home. Pt reported he is still paying attention to carbs in meals, like rice, tortilla, bean.
Fluid intake: pt admitted not drinking enough water
Physical activities: ride bicycle, work in the backyard
Other relevant info reported by pt: pt recently started amlodipine and ozempic, pt reported low appetite, no N/V; pt experienced missing doses of ozempic due to shortage. pt has been having headache; pt reported having poor sleep, wakes up frequently at night and feels tired during the day

Objective:
Age: 63
Gender: Male
Home-Monitored Vitals: Pt checks BP and BG once daily. Avg BG for the past 30 days is 196 mg/dl (9 pre meal BG and 21 post meal BG). Avg BP for the past 30 days is 133/72 mmHg (31 readings).
Meds: 55 units of insulin at night; ozempic 1 mg once per week; ​​ezetimibe; amlodipine
Medical diagnosis: T2DM, HLD, secondary HTN due to endocrine disorders, obesity
Labs: A1c 9.0%, improved from the previous one 9.1%. CMP all normal except glucose 132. Lipid panel all WNL (11/2/23)

Assessment:
BG: Avg BG for the past 30 days is 196 mg/dl, decreased from 234 mg/dl the previous 30 days. Pt checks BG usually in the PM, before or after dinner. Increased frequency of checking from 24 to 31. Avg pre meal BG = 159 and post meal BG=211. Both improved from the previous 30 days.
BP: Avg BP for the past 30 days is 133/72 based on 31 readings, improved from 138/74 the previous 30 days. Pt checked BP daily in the evening
BP is showing great improvement since enrollment. Baseline BP in Dec 2023: avg at 154/86 and 99% of readings are in stage 2 HTN range. Compared to the past month: avg of 133/72 and 77% of BP readings are in stage 1 HTN or below.

Plan:
Diet Recommendations:
Educate the patient about hydration, 6-8 cups of water; use fruits/veggies to flavor water.
To address the side effect of Ozempic:
Low appetite/easily full: suggest the patient to have small frequent meals, focus on protein rich food, having 2-3 hrs apart from each meal instead of constantly eating, having a wider eating window. Suggest the patient to chew food well, choosing more cooked veggies, lower fat foods and do not drinking with meals.
To manage BG with missing dose of ozempic:
Suggest the patient to check BG more often to stay on top of the numbers, consider cutting down on carbohydrates, having high fiber foods, increase exercise such as cardio and strength training. If the medication continues to be short, talk to PCP about switching the medication. 
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Encourage the patient to  continue checking BP and BG daily, encouraged paired BG readings.
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to remind the patient to get an updated A1c and reassess the patient's meal intake especially CHO portion and quality

Here is the the patient case you need to work on to generate the treatment plan:

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 
## Treatment Plan for Case 6:

**Assessment:**

This 65-year-old male patient presents with uncontrolled T2DM (A1c 9.1%) despite being on Metformin and Rybelsus. He demonstrates a desire to improve but struggles with inconsistent meal times, frequent fast food consumption, a carbohydrate-heavy diet, and lack of consistent physical activity. He identifies as a “fly by the seat of his pants” type of person, indicating a potential challenge with planning and structure. 

**Goals:**

* **Short-term:** Reduce average blood glucose to below 200 mg/dL.
* **Long-term:** Achieve and maintain A1c below 7%.
* **Behavioral:** Improve consistency with meal timing and food choices. Increase physical activity levels.

**Plan:**

**Diet Recommendations:**

* **Meal Timing:** 
    * Emphasize the importance of consistent meal timing to help regulate blood sugar levels. 
    * Collaborate with the patient to develop a realistic meal schedule that fits his lifestyle.
    * Explore the use of visual aids or phone reminders to prompt meals.
* **Fast Food Alternatives:**
    * Acknowledge the convenience of fast food but highlight its negative impact on blood sugar control.
    * Provide a list of healthier fast-food options and modifications (e.g., grilled chicken sandwiches without mayonnaise, salads with dressing on the side).
    * Encourage bringing lunch from home on workdays.
* **Carbohydrate Management:**
    * Educate on the impact of carbohydrates on blood sugar and portion control.
    * Explore carbohydrate counting or the plate method as tools for managing carbohydrate intake.
    * Suggest substituting lower-carbohydrate alternatives for high-carbohydrate favorites (e.g., cauliflower rice for white rice, lettuce wraps for tortillas).
* **Increase Vegetable Intake:**
    * Acknowledge the patient's dislike for vegetables and explore alternative ways to incorporate them.
    * Suggest adding vegetables to smoothies, soups, or sauces.
    * Experiment with different cooking methods and seasonings to improve palatability.
* **Alcohol Moderation:**
    * Discuss the impact of alcohol on blood sugar and potential interactions with medications.
    * Encourage reducing alcohol intake to recommended guidelines (no more than 2 drinks per day).
    * Suggest lower-carbohydrate alcoholic beverages (e.g., dry wine, spirits with sugar-free mixers).

**Physical Activities:**

* **Gradual Increase:**
    * Encourage a gradual increase in physical activity to avoid overwhelm and reduce injury risk.
    * Start with short walks (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase duration and frequency.
    * Explore activities the patient enjoys and can easily incorporate into his routine.
* **Structure and Accountability:**
    * Help the patient establish a consistent walking schedule and identify potential barriers.
    * Suggest finding a walking buddy or joining a walking group for motivation and support.
    * Encourage the use of a fitness tracker or app to monitor progress and stay accountable.

**Medication:**

* **Compliance:**
    * Review medication regimen and emphasize the importance of adherence.
    * Explore any barriers to medication adherence and problem-solve together.
* **Efficacy:**
    * Monitor blood glucose trends and discuss with the prescribing physician if medication adjustments are needed.

**Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:**

* **Motivational Interviewing:**
    * Utilize motivational interviewing techniques to explore the patient's ambivalence towards change and build intrinsic motivation.
    * Focus on the patient's values and goals, and connect healthy behaviors to those values.
* **Problem-Solving:**
    * Collaborate with the patient to identify potential barriers to change and develop practical solutions.
    * Break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**
    * Acknowledge and celebrate the patient's successes, no matter how small.
    * Focus on progress, not perfection.

**Follow-up:**

* Schedule regular follow-up appointments (every 2-4 weeks) to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust the plan as needed.
* Encourage communication between appointments for any questions or concerns.

**Overall Approach:**

This patient requires a collaborative and flexible approach that acknowledges his personality and lifestyle. By focusing on small, achievable changes, building self-efficacy, and providing ongoing support, we can empower him to take control of his health and achieve his blood sugar goals.

Plan:
Diet Recommendations:
Educate the patient about hydration, 6-8 cups of water; use fruits/veggies to flavor water.
To address the side effect of Ozempic:
Low appetite/easily full: suggest the patient to have small frequent meals, focus on protein rich food, having 2-3 hrs apart from each meal instead of constantly eating, having a wider eating window. Suggest the patient to chew food well, choosing more cooked veggies, lower fat foods and do not drinking with meals.
To manage BG with missing dose of ozempic:
Suggest the patient to check BG more often to stay on top of the numbers, consider cutting down on carbohydrates, having high fiber foods, increase exercise such as cardio and strength training. If the medication continues to be short, talk to PCP about switching the medication. 
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Encourage the patient to  continue checking BP and BG daily, encouraged paired BG readings.
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to remind the patient to get an updated A1c and reassess the patient's meal intake especially CHO portion and quality

============================================================
Imaging you are a registered dietitian who sees patient for nutrition counseling sessions and remotely monitoring the patient's blood glucose management. Your job is to come up with a treatment plan to address the high A1C status for the patient based on the subjective information, objective information, and the assessment provided. 

Here are a few examples of the patient cases with subjective information, objective information, assessment and the treatment plan: 
Example 1:Subjective:

Home-monitored vitals: Pt has not checked BP or BG recently
Pt doesn't see an Endocrinologist

Assessment:
Pt with uncontrolled DM r/t A1c on 9.7%. Pt has a long history of DM and interventions focused on including more activity after meals and smaller portions of carbohydrates were previously discussed. 

Plan: 
Physical Activities: 
Recommend walking for at least 15 minutes after meals.
Encourage strength training exercises.
Diet Recommendations:
Discuss reducing portions of carbohydrates and pairing them with protein.
Flour Alternatives: Use whole wheat flour instead of white flour for roti/chapati/paratha; use lentil flour (besan/chickpea) instead of white flour.
Vegetable Additions: Add more vegetables to dough/batter when possible.
Snack Foods: Limit/avoid fried snack foods and desserts.
Beverages: For chai, use natural sweeteners (monk fruit, stevia) and low-fat or plant-based milk.
Adding more protein to the diet: add more chutney, greek yogurt
Using brown rice and monitoring portion size
Medication:
Jardiance and metformin seem appropriate. Assess how long the patient has been taking Pioglitazone, consider if a GLP-1 agonist may be better. 
Education:
Educate the patient on the relationship between carbohydrate foods and their effect on blood sugar.
Educate the patient on A1c, its definition and its importance
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Try to get more BG readings during the day: fasting 3 times a week and paired 3 times a week.
Follow up:
Patient to follow up with the provider. Regular follow up with RD.
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
Consider to change BG monitoring schedule to pair reading/pos meal day time BG to help the patient visualize his high A1c, then propose dietary adjustment /strength training
Get an understanding about what the patient eats with meals, the exact amount of carbohydrates patient is consuming, and at what times.
Ask if the patient checks paired glucose levels. Suggest mealtime paired readings to understand which foods are more problematic and the tipping point for carbohydrate intake

Example 2: 
Subjective:
Medical hx: Pt is on insulin and had a history of frequently forgetting taking them
Diet: diet remained the same after counseling (having a big portion of watermelon with oatmeals for breakfast)
Physical activities: 
Patient’s questions, reported knowledge, stated beliefs and attitudes: Pt previously worked with RDs, struggled with controlling portion size of carbs in her meals 

Objective:

Encourage the patient to always include scrambled eggs and mixed nuts in breakfast, lean protein sources and vegetables in lunch/dinner
Medication:
Remind the patient about insulin and meds compliance
Education:
Educate the patient regarding T2DM, insulin, BG and quality of life (how improving BG is going to benefit her overall quality of life; the importance of health and what does it mean)
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD continue to monitor food logs and blood sugar levels. 
RD could ask the patient how she feels about the feedback on her food log pictures.
RD could work with the patient to make a list of topic that the patient would love to talk about (with different levels of concern/confidence)

Example 3: 
Subjective:
Chief complaints: pain and uncontrolled hyperglycemia
Medical hx: T2DM, HTN, arthritis, nephrolithiasis, CKD Stage 3a, sickle cell trait, dorsalgia/sciatica (L hip pain), spinal stenosis, and BPH. Pt went to ER for hip pain on 3/5/2024, had an Ortho appt on 3/11/2024. 
Surgical hx: Previously rotator cuff sx in March 2024
Occupation/schedule: Pt is a former athlete football player, works for sheriff dept and coaches at highschool, has not been working since March. 
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: No alcohol or smoke
Patient’s questions, reported knowledge, stated beliefs and attitudes: Pt has been unresponsive to the care team but came in to get a new BG device recently and took a BG and a BP reading.  

Objective:
Age: 73
Gender: Male
Weight: 247 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: BP on 4/10/24 was 149/83 mmHg, only one BG reading in the past 90 days and it was 276 mg/dL. Pt had been inactive due to technical issues with home-monitoring devices, difficult to reach by RD. 
Meds: Atenolol 25 mg qd, Losartan 100 mg, Humalog 22 units TID w/meals, Lantus 50 units daily (not taking consistently), Jardiance 25 mg, Ibuprofen 800 mg, Tramadol 50 mg, Prednisone 10 mg BID. 
Last PCP visit on 3/7/24 s/p ER visit r/t pain 
Labs: 9.1% A1c on 2/6/2024; 9.2% A1c on 4/9/2023.

Assessment:
The patient has been responsive recently. Pt is dealing with a lot of pain so hyperglycemia is likely not his number one priority, and it would be difficult for him to be responsive with that much pain. Pt was given a new BG device recently and might be better to reframe goals of his BG management oriented around pain management.

Plan:

RD to reach out to the patient again to re-establish communication given new BG device
RD to reframe goals oriented around pain management using motivational interviewing

Example 4: 
Subjective:
Medical hx:  In addition to type 2 DM, patient has diagnosis of depression, unspecified dysphagia, hemiplegia, hypothyroidism, PTSD, dysarthria and anarthria (RD spoke with patient’s daughter for their joint appointments), and COPD. Patient reports having a stroke 2 to 3 years ago and stated she was bedridden for 2 months with a cyst with related weight loss on 4/5/24.
Relevant social hx: Pt's daughter lives with her and helps with her care, but daughter appears easily overwhelmed and has a hard time remembering to test blood sugar and give medications/insulin regularly. Daughter is also in our program for BG monitoring and is fairly noncompliant as well. They have both shown some recent improvement in compliance though, patient more so than her daughter.
Diet: food storage is limited to a mini fridge/freezer and food preparation is limited to a microwave. Patient has started drinking Hint waters instead of soda.
Physical Activities: Patient reports walking two laps around one of the hotel buildings daily and tried increasing to three laps but fell.
Readiness to change: Patient’s stage of change is contemplation. Barriers to change include being technically homeless, currently living in a hotel room in a reportedly unsafe area

Objective:
Age: 56
Gender: Female
Height: 5'3""
Weight: 173 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: 30-day BG average is 421 mg/dL as of 6/10/24 based on 12 readings; Out-of-rang BG readings reported on 5/30, 5/28, and 5/27.
Meds: Patient is prescribed 50 units of Basaglar daily and lispro per sliding scale 3 times a day with a 30 unit daily max. 
Labs: A1c trend as of 6/10/24 - trended down from >14% in 2/2023 to 10.7% in 12/2023

Assessment: 
Patient has a h/o routine OOR readings; hard to tell whether patient has more recently improved as far as vitals monitoring regularity, the readings themselves, or both. Main problem to focus on is medication compliance; if patient becomes more compliant to prescribed medication regimen, PCP should be more willing to make any necessary changes. Secondary problem is patient’s lack of access to balanced food choices and limited means to prepare them with. Patient and patient’s daughter have responded well to repeated reminders about patient’s prescribed insulin regimen, ideas on how to remember to give it on a daily basis, and suggestions of unsweetened beverages to try.

Plan:
Goals: 
Improve insulin and BG testing routine
Medication:
Gradually get the patient to use insulin exactly as prescribed.
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Suggest the daughter to check 2 hours post-meal BG for the next couple weeks to see how many insulin the patient actually needs.
Resources Provided:
Share resources on food banks, SNAP (if applicable), and foods requiring little to no cooking/refrigeration
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to get to know the carb amount the patient consumes; ideally to get pre-meal BG readings, post-meal BG readings and food logs.
Takes baby steps with the patient.

Example 5:

BP is showing great improvement since enrollment. Baseline BP in Dec 2023: avg at 154/86 and 99% of readings are in stage 2 HTN range. Compared to the past month: avg of 133/72 and 77% of BP readings are in stage 1 HTN or below.

Plan:
Diet Recommendations:
Educate the patient about hydration, 6-8 cups of water; use fruits/veggies to flavor water.
To address the side effect of Ozempic:
Low appetite/easily full: suggest the patient to have small frequent meals, focus on protein rich food, having 2-3 hrs apart from each meal instead of constantly eating, having a wider eating window. Suggest the patient to chew food well, choosing more cooked veggies, lower fat foods and do not drinking with meals.
To manage BG with missing dose of ozempic:
Suggest the patient to check BG more often to stay on top of the numbers, consider cutting down on carbohydrates, having high fiber foods, increase exercise such as cardio and strength training. If the medication continues to be short, talk to PCP about switching the medication. 
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Encourage the patient to  continue checking BP and BG daily, encouraged paired BG readings.

Educate the patient regarding T2DM, insulin, BG and quality of life (how improving BG is going to benefit her overall quality of life; the importance of health and what does it mean)
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD continue to monitor food logs and blood sugar levels. 
RD could ask the patient how she feels about the feedback on her food log pictures.
RD could work with the patient to make a list of topic that the patient would love to talk about (with different levels of concern/confidence)

Example 3: 
Subjective:
Chief complaints: pain and uncontrolled hyperglycemia
Medical hx: T2DM, HTN, arthritis, nephrolithiasis, CKD Stage 3a, sickle cell trait, dorsalgia/sciatica (L hip pain), spinal stenosis, and BPH. Pt went to ER for hip pain on 3/5/2024, had an Ortho appt on 3/11/2024. 
Surgical hx: Previously rotator cuff sx in March 2024
Occupation/schedule: Pt is a former athlete football player, works for sheriff dept and coaches at highschool, has not been working since March. 
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: No alcohol or smoke
Patient’s questions, reported knowledge, stated beliefs and attitudes: Pt has been unresponsive to the care team but came in to get a new BG device recently and took a BG and a BP reading.  

Objective:
Age: 73
Gender: Male
Weight: 247 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: BP on 4/10/24 was 149/83 mmHg, only one BG reading in the past 90 days and it was 276 mg/dL. Pt had been inactive due to technical issues with home-monitoring devices, difficult to reach by RD. 
Meds: Atenolol 25 mg qd, Losartan 100 mg, Humalog 22 units TID w/meals, Lantus 50 units daily (not taking consistently), Jardiance 25 mg, Ibuprofen 800 mg, Tramadol 50 mg, Prednisone 10 mg BID. 
Last PCP visit on 3/7/24 s/p ER visit r/t pain 
Labs: 9.1% A1c on 2/6/2024; 9.2% A1c on 4/9/2023.

Assessment:
The patient has been responsive recently. Pt is dealing with a lot of pain so hyperglycemia is likely not his number one priority, and it would be difficult for him to be responsive with that much pain. Pt was given a new BG device recently and might be better to reframe goals of his BG management oriented around pain management.

Plan:
Physical Activities: 
Suggest the patient to see a Physical Therapist if he hasn't seen one
Diet Recommendations:
Nutrition to support pain management, suggest the patient to have some go to snacks/meals
Medication:
Discuss the importance of insulin compliance with the patient.
Follow up:
More regular follow ups
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to reach out to the patient again to re-establish communication given new BG device
RD to reframe goals oriented around pain management using motivational interviewing

Example 4: 
Subjective:
Medical hx:  In addition to type 2 DM, patient has diagnosis of depression, unspecified dysphagia, hemiplegia, hypothyroidism, PTSD, dysarthria and anarthria (RD spoke with patient’s daughter for their joint appointments), and COPD. Patient reports having a stroke 2 to 3 years ago and stated she was bedridden for 2 months with a cyst with related weight loss on 4/5/24.
Relevant social hx: Pt's daughter lives with her and helps with her care, but daughter appears easily overwhelmed and has a hard time remembering to test blood sugar and give medications/insulin regularly. Daughter is also in our program for BG monitoring and is fairly noncompliant as well. They have both shown some recent improvement in compliance though, patient more so than her daughter.
Diet: food storage is limited to a mini fridge/freezer and food preparation is limited to a microwave. Patient has started drinking Hint waters instead of soda.
Physical Activities: Patient reports walking two laps around one of the hotel buildings daily and tried increasing to three laps but fell.
Readiness to change: Patient’s stage of change is contemplation. Barriers to change include being technically homeless, currently living in a hotel room in a reportedly unsafe area
Other relevant info reported by pt: Patient reports taking 60 units Basaglar daily and 15 units of lispro twice a day. Patient doesn't trust herself to give herself her own injections when daughter is not there. Patient’s daughter wrote and posted correct insulin dose on fridge for patient.

Objective:
Age: 56
Gender: Female
Height: 5'3""
Weight: 173 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: 30-day BG average is 421 mg/dL as of 6/10/24 based on 12 readings; Out-of-rang BG readings reported on 5/30, 5/28, and 5/27.
Meds: Patient is prescribed 50 units of Basaglar daily and lispro per sliding scale 3 times a day with a 30 unit daily max. 
Labs: A1c trend as of 6/10/24 - trended down from >14% in 2/2023 to 10.7% in 12/2023

Assessment: 
Patient has a h/o routine OOR readings; hard to tell whether patient has more recently improved as far as vitals monitoring regularity, the readings themselves, or both. Main problem to focus on is medication compliance; if patient becomes more compliant to prescribed medication regimen, PCP should be more willing to make any necessary changes. Secondary problem is patient’s lack of access to balanced food choices and limited means to prepare them with. Patient and patient’s daughter have responded well to repeated reminders about patient’s prescribed insulin regimen, ideas on how to remember to give it on a daily basis, and suggestions of unsweetened beverages to try.

Plan:
Goals: 
Improve insulin and BG testing routine
Medication:
Gradually get the patient to use insulin exactly as prescribed.
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Suggest the daughter to check 2 hours post-meal BG for the next couple weeks to see how many insulin the patient actually needs.
Resources Provided:
Share resources on food banks, SNAP (if applicable), and foods requiring little to no cooking/refrigeration
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to get to know the carb amount the patient consumes; ideally to get pre-meal BG readings, post-meal BG readings and food logs.
Takes baby steps with the patient.

Example 5: 
Subjective:
Relevant social hx: Pt lives with wife 
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: Not drinking/smoking
Diet: Wife cooks and mostly eats at home. Pt reported he is still paying attention to carbs in meals, like rice, tortilla, bean.
Fluid intake: pt admitted not drinking enough water
Physical activities: ride bicycle, work in the backyard
Other relevant info reported by pt: pt recently started amlodipine and ozempic, pt reported low appetite, no N/V; pt experienced missing doses of ozempic due to shortage. pt has been having headache; pt reported having poor sleep, wakes up frequently at night and feels tired during the day

Objective:
Age: 63
Gender: Male
Home-Monitored Vitals: Pt checks BP and BG once daily. Avg BG for the past 30 days is 196 mg/dl (9 pre meal BG and 21 post meal BG). Avg BP for the past 30 days is 133/72 mmHg (31 readings).
Meds: 55 units of insulin at night; ozempic 1 mg once per week; ​​ezetimibe; amlodipine
Medical diagnosis: T2DM, HLD, secondary HTN due to endocrine disorders, obesity
Labs: A1c 9.0%, improved from the previous one 9.1%. CMP all normal except glucose 132. Lipid panel all WNL (11/2/23)

Assessment:
BG: Avg BG for the past 30 days is 196 mg/dl, decreased from 234 mg/dl the previous 30 days. Pt checks BG usually in the PM, before or after dinner. Increased frequency of checking from 24 to 31. Avg pre meal BG = 159 and post meal BG=211. Both improved from the previous 30 days.
BP: Avg BP for the past 30 days is 133/72 based on 31 readings, improved from 138/74 the previous 30 days. Pt checked BP daily in the evening
BP is showing great improvement since enrollment. Baseline BP in Dec 2023: avg at 154/86 and 99% of readings are in stage 2 HTN range. Compared to the past month: avg of 133/72 and 77% of BP readings are in stage 1 HTN or below.

Plan:
Diet Recommendations:
Educate the patient about hydration, 6-8 cups of water; use fruits/veggies to flavor water.
To address the side effect of Ozempic:
Low appetite/easily full: suggest the patient to have small frequent meals, focus on protein rich food, having 2-3 hrs apart from each meal instead of constantly eating, having a wider eating window. Suggest the patient to chew food well, choosing more cooked veggies, lower fat foods and do not drinking with meals.
To manage BG with missing dose of ozempic:
Suggest the patient to check BG more often to stay on top of the numbers, consider cutting down on carbohydrates, having high fiber foods, increase exercise such as cardio and strength training. If the medication continues to be short, talk to PCP about switching the medication. 
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Encourage the patient to  continue checking BP and BG daily, encouraged paired BG readings.
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to remind the patient to get an updated A1c and reassess the patient's meal intake especially CHO portion and quality

Here is the the patient case you need to work on to generate the treatment plan: 
Case 9:

By implementing this comprehensive treatment plan and fostering a strong therapeutic relationship, we can empower this patient to improve his blood sugar control, reduce his risk of complications, and enhance his overall well-being. 

============================================================
Imaging you are a registered dietitian who sees patient for nutrition counseling sessions and remotely monitoring the patient's blood glucose management. Your job is to come up with a treatment plan to address the high A1C status for the patient based on the subjective information, objective information, and the assessment provided. 

Here are a few examples of the patient cases with subjective information, objective information, assessment and the treatment plan: 
Example 1:Subjective:
Medical hx: T2DM for ~20 years, HTN for ~20 years, HLD. Pt feels that T2DM is generally well controlled.
Relevant social hx: Lives with family
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: Not smoking; drinks once a week, shot of hard liquor
Diet recall: Pt reports follows typical indian diet, three meals a day with dinner usually being the lightest meal. Pt also has tea and cookies/biscuits in the afternoon. Pt is mostly vegetarian has lentils most often for protein, eats vegetables,  diet a bit higher in carbs
Physical activities: Pt reports walking briskly twice daily for at least 30 minutes 

Objective: 
Age: 78
Gender: male
Meds: Jardiance 25 mg 1x/day, Metformin 1000 mg BID, Pioglitazone 45 mg 1x/day
Labs: 8/4/23 - A1C was 9.6%, 3/12/24 A1C was 9.7%.
Home-monitored vitals: Pt has not checked BP or BG recently
Pt doesn't see an Endocrinologist

Assessment:
Pt with uncontrolled DM r/t A1c on 9.7%. Pt has a long history of DM and interventions focused on including more activity after meals and smaller portions of carbohydrates were previously discussed. 

Plan: 
Physical Activities: 
Recommend walking for at least 15 minutes after meals.
Encourage strength training exercises.
Diet Recommendations:
Discuss reducing portions of carbohydrates and pairing them with protein.
Flour Alternatives: Use whole wheat flour instead of white flour for roti/chapati/paratha; use lentil flour (besan/chickpea) instead of white flour.
Vegetable Additions: Add more vegetables to dough/batter when possible.
Snack Foods: Limit/avoid fried snack foods and desserts.
Beverages: For chai, use natural sweeteners (monk fruit, stevia) and low-fat or plant-based milk.
Adding more protein to the diet: add more chutney, greek yogurt
Using brown rice and monitoring portion size
Medication:
Jardiance and metformin seem appropriate. Assess how long the patient has been taking Pioglitazone, consider if a GLP-1 agonist may be better. 
Education:
Educate the patient on the relationship between carbohydrate foods and their effect on blood sugar.
Educate the patient on A1c, its definition and its importance
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Try to get more BG readings during the day: fasting 3 times a week and paired 3 times a week.
Follow up:
Patient to follow up with the provider. Regular follow up with RD.
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
Consider to change BG monitoring schedule to pair reading/pos meal day time BG to help the patient visualize his high A1c, then propose dietary adjustment /strength training
Get an understanding about what the patient eats with meals, the exact amount of carbohydrates patient is consuming, and at what times.
Ask if the patient checks paired glucose levels. Suggest mealtime paired readings to understand which foods are more problematic and the tipping point for carbohydrate intake

Example 2: 
Subjective:
Medical hx: Pt is on insulin and had a history of frequently forgetting taking them
Diet: diet remained the same after counseling (having a big portion of watermelon with oatmeals for breakfast)
Physical activities:

Assessment:
Overconsumption of carbohydrates d/t lack of nutrition knowledge or low levels of readiness of changes in the past
Completed F/U with RD on 02/15/24, discussed carb sources and controlling portion size, adding proteins and healthy fat sources to meals; pt has made significant progress

Plan:
Physical Activities: 
Encourage physical activities/mobility, remind the patient about the insurance coverage for PT and certain health conditions
Diet Recommendations:
Encourage the patient to always include scrambled eggs and mixed nuts in breakfast, lean protein sources and vegetables in lunch/dinner
Medication:
Remind the patient about insulin and meds compliance
Education:
Educate the patient regarding T2DM, insulin, BG and quality of life (how improving BG is going to benefit her overall quality of life; the importance of health and what does it mean)
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD continue to monitor food logs and blood sugar levels. 
RD could ask the patient how she feels about the feedback on her food log pictures.
RD could work with the patient to make a list of topic that the patient would love to talk about (with different levels of concern/confidence)

Example 3: 
Subjective:
Chief complaints: pain and uncontrolled hyperglycemia
Medical hx: T2DM, HTN, arthritis, nephrolithiasis, CKD Stage 3a, sickle cell trait, dorsalgia/sciatica (L hip pain), spinal stenosis, and BPH. Pt went to ER for hip pain on 3/5/2024, had an Ortho appt on 3/11/2024. 
Surgical hx: Previously rotator cuff sx in March 2024
Occupation/schedule: Pt is a former athlete football player, works for sheriff dept and coaches at highschool, has not been working since March. 
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: No alcohol or smoke
Patient’s questions, reported knowledge, stated beliefs and attitudes: Pt has been unresponsive to the care team but came in to get a new BG device recently and took a BG and a BP reading.  

Objective:
Age: 73
Gender: Male
Weight: 247 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: BP on 4/10/24 was 149/83 mmHg, only one BG reading in the past 90 days and it was 276 mg/dL. Pt had been inactive due to technical issues with home-monitoring devices, difficult to reach by RD. 
Meds: Atenolol 25 mg qd, Losartan 100 mg, Humalog 22 units TID w/meals, Lantus 50 units daily (not taking consistently), Jardiance 25 mg, Ibuprofen 800 mg, Tramadol 50 mg, Prednisone 10 mg BID. 
Last PCP visit on 3/7/24 s/p ER visit r/t pain 
Labs: 9.1% A1c on 2/6/2024; 9.2% A1c on 4/9/2023.

Assessment:
The patient has been responsive recently. Pt is dealing with a lot of pain so hyperglycemia is likely not his number one priority, and it would be difficult for him to be responsive with that much pain. Pt was given a new BG device recently and might be better to reframe goals of his BG management oriented around pain management.

Plan:
Physical Activities: 
Suggest the patient to see a Physical Therapist if he hasn't seen one
Diet Recommendations:
Nutrition to support pain management, suggest the patient to have some go to snacks/meals
Medication:
Discuss the importance of insulin compliance with the patient.
Follow up:
More regular follow ups
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to reach out to the patient again to re-establish communication given new BG device
RD to reframe goals oriented around pain management using motivational interviewing

Example 4: 
Subjective:
Medical hx:  In addition to type 2 DM, patient has diagnosis of depression, unspecified dysphagia, hemiplegia, hypothyroidism, PTSD, dysarthria and anarthria (RD spoke with patient’s daughter for their joint appointments), and COPD. Patient reports having a stroke 2 to 3 years ago and stated she was bedridden for 2 months with a cyst with related weight loss on 4/5/24.
Relevant social hx: Pt's daughter lives with her and helps with her care, but daughter appears easily overwhelmed and has a hard time remembering to test blood sugar and give medications/insulin regularly. Daughter is also in our program for BG monitoring and is fairly noncompliant as well. They have both shown some recent improvement in compliance though, patient more so than her daughter.
Diet: food storage is limited to a mini fridge/freezer and food preparation is limited to a microwave. Patient has started drinking Hint waters instead of soda.
Physical Activities: Patient reports walking two laps around one of the hotel buildings daily and tried increasing to three laps but fell.
Readiness to change: Patient’s stage of change is contemplation. Barriers to change include being technically homeless, currently living in a hotel room in a reportedly unsafe area
Other relevant info reported by pt: Patient reports taking 60 units Basaglar daily and 15 units of lispro twice a day. Patient doesn't trust herself to give herself her own injections when daughter is not there. Patient’s daughter wrote and posted correct insulin dose on fridge for patient.

Objective:
Age: 56
Gender: Female
Height: 5'3""
Weight: 173 lbs
Home-Monitored Vitals: 30-day BG average is 421 mg/dL as of 6/10/24 based on 12 readings; Out-of-rang BG readings reported on 5/30, 5/28, and 5/27.
Meds: Patient is prescribed 50 units of Basaglar daily and lispro per sliding scale 3 times a day with a 30 unit daily max. 
Labs: A1c trend as of 6/10/24 - trended down from >14% in 2/2023 to 10.7% in 12/2023

Assessment: 
Patient has a h/o routine OOR readings; hard to tell whether patient has more recently improved as far as vitals monitoring regularity, the readings themselves, or both. Main problem to focus on is medication compliance; if patient becomes more compliant to prescribed medication regimen, PCP should be more willing to make any necessary changes. Secondary problem is patient’s lack of access to balanced food choices and limited means to prepare them with. Patient and patient’s daughter have responded well to repeated reminders about patient’s prescribed insulin regimen, ideas on how to remember to give it on a daily basis, and suggestions of unsweetened beverages to try.

Plan:
Goals: 
Improve insulin and BG testing routine
Medication:
Gradually get the patient to use insulin exactly as prescribed.
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Suggest the daughter to check 2 hours post-meal BG for the next couple weeks to see how many insulin the patient actually needs.
Resources Provided:
Share resources on food banks, SNAP (if applicable), and foods requiring little to no cooking/refrigeration
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to get to know the carb amount the patient consumes; ideally to get pre-meal BG readings, post-meal BG readings and food logs.
Takes baby steps with the patient.

Example 5: 
Subjective:
Relevant social hx: Pt lives with wife 
Tobacco/alcohol/substance use: Not drinking/smoking
Diet: Wife cooks and mostly eats at home. Pt reported he is still paying attention to carbs in meals, like rice, tortilla, bean.
Fluid intake: pt admitted not drinking enough water
Physical activities: ride bicycle, work in the backyard
Other relevant info reported by pt: pt recently started amlodipine and ozempic, pt reported low appetite, no N/V; pt experienced missing doses of ozempic due to shortage. pt has been having headache; pt reported having poor sleep, wakes up frequently at night and feels tired during the day

Objective:
Age: 63
Gender: Male
Home-Monitored Vitals: Pt checks BP and BG once daily. Avg BG for the past 30 days is 196 mg/dl (9 pre meal BG and 21 post meal BG). Avg BP for the past 30 days is 133/72 mmHg (31 readings).
Meds: 55 units of insulin at night; ozempic 1 mg once per week; ​​ezetimibe; amlodipine
Medical diagnosis: T2DM, HLD, secondary HTN due to endocrine disorders, obesity
Labs: A1c 9.0%, improved from the previous one 9.1%. CMP all normal except glucose 132. Lipid panel all WNL (11/2/23)

Assessment:
BG: Avg BG for the past 30 days is 196 mg/dl, decreased from 234 mg/dl the previous 30 days. Pt checks BG usually in the PM, before or after dinner. Increased frequency of checking from 24 to 31. Avg pre meal BG = 159 and post meal BG=211. Both improved from the previous 30 days.
BP: Avg BP for the past 30 days is 133/72 based on 31 readings, improved from 138/74 the previous 30 days. Pt checked BP daily in the evening
BP is showing great improvement since enrollment. Baseline BP in Dec 2023: avg at 154/86 and 99% of readings are in stage 2 HTN range. Compared to the past month: avg of 133/72 and 77% of BP readings are in stage 1 HTN or below.

Plan:
Diet Recommendations:
Educate the patient about hydration, 6-8 cups of water; use fruits/veggies to flavor water.
To address the side effect of Ozempic:
Low appetite/easily full: suggest the patient to have small frequent meals, focus on protein rich food, having 2-3 hrs apart from each meal instead of constantly eating, having a wider eating window. Suggest the patient to chew food well, choosing more cooked veggies, lower fat foods and do not drinking with meals.
To manage BG with missing dose of ozempic:
Suggest the patient to check BG more often to stay on top of the numbers, consider cutting down on carbohydrates, having high fiber foods, increase exercise such as cardio and strength training. If the medication continues to be short, talk to PCP about switching the medication. 
Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring:
Encourage the patient to  continue checking BP and BG daily, encouraged paired BG readings.
Counseling Techniques/Suggestions:
RD to remind the patient to get an updated A1c and reassess the patient's meal intake especially CHO portion and quality

Here is the the patient case you need to work on to generate the treatment plan: 
Case 10:
