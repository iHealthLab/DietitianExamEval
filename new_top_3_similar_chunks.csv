 'butyrate, propionate, and acetate). Soluble fiber can\nalso act as a substrate for colonic fermentation. Short bowel patients with an\nintact colon can salvage up to an additional 1000 kcal per day from\nfermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates into absorbable short-chain fatty\nacids (Nordgaard, 1996).\n\nAlthough macronutrients are capable of being absorbed throughout the small\nintestine, micronutrients are more site specific. Calcium and water-soluble\nvitamins are absorbed throughout the small intestine and deficiency is not\ncommonly seen in SBS. Non-heme iron and folate are primarily absorbed in the\nduodenum or proximal jejunum and the distal ileum is the site for bile salt and\nfood-bound vitamin B-12 absorption (DaSilva, 2009; Tappenden, 2014).\nFat-soluble vitamin deficiency is common for patients with ileal resections since\ninsufficient bile salt concentrations can lead to steatorrhea and fat-soluble\nvitamin malabsorption (Jeejeebhoy, 2002).\n\nAfter massive resection of the small intestine, the absorptive surface area is\nreduced and there is rapid transit of intestinal content. Up to 8 L to 9 L of fluid\nper day reaches the small bowel with a greater absorptive capacity in the\nproximal bowel. Typically proximal resections result in minimal bowel\ndisturbances as the ileum and colon can adapt and absorb the increased fluid\nand electrolyte load (Tappenden, 2014).\n\nThere are three anatomical types of SBS dependent on remaining bowel;\nend-jejunostomy, jejunocolic anastomosis, and jejunoileal anastomosis. With\nremoval of specific areas of intestine, each anatomical type has altered\nanatomy and pathophysiology leading to varying severity of symptoms. The\nfollowing table presents important characteristics from each group.\n\nEnd-Jejunostomy\n\nJejunocolic Anastomosis\n\nJejunoileal\nAnastomosis\n\nCopyright 2024 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

This includes not\nonly types of food eaten but also types of drinks consumed (including liquid\nnutritional supplements), amount of food consumed, and timing of meals. Food\nallergies and intolerances must also be noted. In addition, medication history\nthat includes both prescription and over-the-counter should be obtained as\nappropriate use of anti-diarrheals and anti-secretory medications can be used in\nconjunction with diet therapy. Having a patient keep a food and medication\ndiary may provide the RDN with useful information in addition to promoting\nincreased patient accountability for managing their diet. When assessing\nnutritional and medication intake, it is important to inquire about previous diets\nand medications prescribed and prior attempts at diet change.

 'dministered  preloads  that  had  constant\nvolume but different energy content (energy density was altered by chang-\ning dietary fat content), there was no consistent difference in subsequent\nsatiety  or  hunger  between  the  various  test  meals  (Durrant  and  Royston,\n1979; Green et al., 1994; Hill et al., 1987; Himaya et al., 1997; Hulshof et\nal., 1993; Louis-Sylvestre et al., 1994; Porrini et al., 1995; Rolls et al., 1994).\nHowever,  in  those  studies  using  isoenergetic  preloads  that  differed  in\nvolume (energy density was altered by changing dietary fat content), there\nwas consistently increased satiety and reduced hunger after consumption\nof  the  low  energy-dense  preload  meals  (i.e.,  those  with  higher  volume)\n(Blundell et al., 1993; Holt et al., 1995; van Amelsvoort et al., 1989, 1990).\nIt  has  been  reported,  however,  that  diets  low  in  fat  and  high  in  carbo-\nhydrate may lead to more rapid return of hunger and increased snacking\nbetween meals (Ludwig et al., 1999a).\n\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.

Because  individuals  were  blinded  to  the  dietary  content  of\nthe treatment diets, the results from these studies demonstrate the short-\nterm effects of energy density after controlling for cognitive influences on\nfood intake.\n\nIt is important that cognitive factors are taken into account during the\ninterpretation of results of preload studies. When individuals were aware\nof  dietary  changes,  they  generally  (Ogden  and  Wardle,  1990;  Shide  and\nRolls, 1995; Wooley, 1972), but not always (Mattes, 1990; Rolls et al., 1989),\ncompensated for changes in energy density and thus minimized changes\nin energy intake.\n\nIn well-controlled, short-term intervention studies lasting several days\nor more, high fat diets were consistently associated with higher spontaneous\nenergy  intake  (Lawton  et  al.,  1993;  Proserpi  et  al.,  1997;  Thomas  et  al.,\n1992).  From  short-  and  longer-term  studies,  volunteers  consistently  con-\nsumed less dietary energy on low fat, low energy dense diets compared to\nhig',
 'of carbohydrate required, either from endogenous\nor exogenous sources, is determined by the brain’s requirement for glucose.\nThe brain is the only true carbohydrate-dependent organ in that it oxidizes\nglucose completely to carbon dioxide and water. Normally, the brain uses\nglucose almost exclusively for its energy needs. The endogenous glucose\nproduction rate in a postabsorptive state correlates very well with the esti-\nmated  size  of  the  brain  from  birth  to  adult  life.  However,  not  all  of  the\nglucose produced is utilized by the brain (Bier et al., 1977; Felig, 1973).\nThe requirement for glucose has been reported to be approximately 110\nto 140 g/d in adults (Cahill et al., 1968). Nevertheless, even the brain can\nadapt  to  a  carbohydrate-free,  energy-sufficient  diet,  or  to  starvation,  by\nutilizing ketoacids for part of its fuel requirements. When glucose produc-\ntion or availability decreases below that required for the complete energy\nrequirements  for  the  brain,  there  is  a  rise  in  ketoacid  production  in  the\nliver in order to provide the brain with an alternative fuel. This has been\nreferred  to  as  “ketosis.”  Generally,  this  occurs  in  a  starving  person  only\nafter glycogen stores in the liver are reduced to a low concentration and\nthe  contribution  of  hepatic  glycogenolysis  is  greatly  reduced  or  absent\n(Cahill et al., 1968). It is associated with approximately a 20 to 50 percent\ndecrease in circulating glucose and insulin concentration (Carlson et al.,\n1994; Owen et al., 1998; Streja et al., 1977). These are signals for adipose\ncells to increase lipolysis and release nonesterified fatty acids and glycerol\ninto the circulation. The signal also is reinforced by an increase in circulat-\ning  epinephrine,  norepinephrine,  glucagon,  and  growth  hormone  con-\ncentration (Carlson et al., 1994). The nonesterified fatty acids are removed\nby  the  liver  and  converted  into  ketoacids,  which  then  diffuse  out  of  the\nliver into the circulation. The increase in nonesterified fatty acids results\nin a concentration-dependent exponential increase in ketoacids (Hanson\net al., 1965); glucagon facilitates this process (Mackrell and Sokal, 1969).\n\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.
