1. Which of the following is an example of an open-ended question that a client would likely respond well to?
A. Why would you want to follow that meal plan? B. Do you use skim milk or whole milk? C. What are some of the challenges you've faced in your weight loss journey? D. Do you feel positive or negative about your weight loss goal? 

## Analyzing the Question:

We need to identify the **open-ended question** from the options. Open-ended questions encourage detailed responses and can't be answered with a simple "yes" or "no". They invite the client to share their thoughts and feelings.

## Evaluating the Options:

* **A. Why would you want to follow that meal plan?**  This is open-ended as it asks for the client's reasoning and motivation.
* **B. Do you use skim milk or whole milk?** This is a closed-ended question requiring a simple choice.
* **C. What are some of the challenges you've faced in your weight loss journey?** This is open-ended, prompting the client to reflect and share their experiences.
* **D. Do you feel positive or negative about your weight loss goal?** This is closed-ended, limiting the response to two options.

## Conclusion:

Options A and C are open-ended. However, option A might make the client defensive, as it questions their choices. Option C is more likely to elicit a positive response as it encourages reflection and sharing.

<answer>C</answer>

2. Which of the following types of study has the potential to prove cause and effect?
A. Randomized controlled trial B. Qualitative survey C. Case-control D. Cohort 

## Step-by-step solution:

1. **Summarize available information:** We are asked to identify the type of study that can prove a cause-and-effect relationship. 

2. **Analyze each option:**
    * **A. Randomized controlled trial:** This study design randomly assigns participants to different groups (e.g., treatment and control), allowing researchers to isolate the effect of the intervention and establish causality.
    * **B. Qualitative survey:** This study design focuses on gathering in-depth information about people's experiences, perspectives, and opinions. It does not involve manipulating variables and cannot establish cause and effect.
    * **C. Case-control:** This study design compares individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls) to identify potential risk factors. While it can suggest associations, it cannot definitively prove causation.
    * **D. Cohort:** This study design follows a group of individuals over time to observe the development of outcomes. While it can establish associations and temporality (exposure preceding outcome), it may not fully account for confounding factors and cannot definitively prove causation.

3. **Identify the best fit:**  Among the options, only randomized controlled trials are specifically designed to control for confounding factors and establish a causal link between an intervention and an outcome.

3. Canned corn has more sodium and less potassium than fresh corn. This is the result of
A. processing. B. enrichment. C. fortification. D. additives. 

Here's how to break down the question:

* **The observation:** Canned corn is higher in sodium and lower in potassium compared to fresh corn.
* **The question:** What causes this difference?

Now let's analyze the answer choices:

* **A. Processing:** This involves various methods to preserve food, which can include adding salt (sodium). Processing can also cause a loss of certain nutrients, potentially including potassium.
* **B. Enrichment:** This is the process of adding back nutrients that were lost during processing. It doesn't explain the higher sodium content.
* **C. Fortification:** This involves adding nutrients that weren't originally present in the food. It doesn't explain the higher sodium or lower potassium.
* **D. Additives:** While some additives are preservatives, this term is too broad. The question specifically points to sodium.

**Conclusion:**

The most likely reason for the difference in sodium and potassium levels between canned and fresh corn is the **processing** method.

15. Which of the following is an example of a positive correlation?
A. “The amount of weight gained by pregnant people during the first trimester has been found to decrease as the number of episodes of nausea and vomiting increase.” B. “The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases as central adiposity increases.” C. “Consuming calories in excess of those needed results in generalized adiposity.” D. “Blood pressure readings in certain populations decrease as messaging about impact of dietary sodium increases.” 

## Analyzing the Multiple Choice Question:

The question asks us to identify an example of a **positive correlation**. 

**What is a positive correlation?**

A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases. They move in the same direction.

**Let's analyze each option:**

* **A. "The amount of weight gained by pregnant people during the first trimester has been found to decrease as the number of episodes of nausea and vomiting increase.”** 
    * This describes an **inverse** relationship, not a positive correlation. As nausea and vomiting (one variable) increase, weight gain (the other variable) decreases.

* **B. “The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases as central adiposity increases.”**
    * This option shows a **positive correlation**. As central adiposity (fat in the abdominal area) increases, the incidence of type 2 diabetes also increases. Both variables move in the same direction.

* **C. “Consuming calories in excess of those needed results in generalized adiposity.”**
    * This statement describes a **cause-and-effect** relationship, not necessarily a correlation. While related, it doesn't directly compare the increase or decrease of two variables.

* **D. “Blood pressure readings in certain populations decrease as messaging about impact of dietary sodium increases.”**
    * This describes an **inverse** relationship. As messaging about sodium increases, blood pressure decreases.

**Conclusion:**

Only option B demonstrates a positive correlation where both variables increase together.

57. The hormone released by gastric cells in response to food in the stomach is
A. gastrin B. secretin C. cholecystokinin D. chymotrypsin 

Here's how we can break down this multiple-choice question:

**Information Summary:**

* **Focus:**  The question asks about a hormone released by cells in the stomach.
* **Stimulus:** The hormone release is triggered by the presence of food in the stomach.
* **Options:** We are given four options, each representing a different hormone or enzyme.

**Step-by-Step Elimination:**

1. **Identify Hormone Functions:** Let's briefly review what each option does:
    * **Gastrin:**  Stimulates the release of gastric acid (HCl) in the stomach.
    * **Secretin:**  Released by the duodenum (part of the small intestine) in response to acidic chyme, stimulating the pancreas to release bicarbonate.
    * **Cholecystokinin (CCK):** Released by the duodenum in response to fats and proteins, stimulating the gallbladder to release bile and the pancreas to release digestive enzymes.
    * **Chymotrypsin:** This is a digestive enzyme, not a hormone. It's released by the pancreas and breaks down proteins in the small intestine.

2. **Match Function to Stimulus:** We need the hormone released *by the stomach* when *food is present*. 

3. **The Answer:** Gastrin is the hormone released by gastric cells (cells in the stomach lining) when food enters the stomach. This release of gastrin then leads to the production of gastric acid, aiding in digestion.

<answer>A. gastrin</answer>

71. What is the upper limit of fat, in grams, that should be consumed by a healthy person requiring 2,500 kcal per day?
A. 875 B. 97 C. 218 D. 71 

The question asks us to calculate the maximum fat intake, in grams, for a healthy individual with a 2,500 kcal daily requirement. 

Here's how to solve it:

* **Know the fat-to-calorie ratio:** Fat provides 9 calories per gram.
* **Calculate the maximum fat calorie allowance:**  A healthy diet should consist of no more than 30% fat. Therefore, fat can contribute up to 2,500 kcal * 0.30 = 750 kcal.
* **Convert calorie allowance to grams:** Divide the maximum fat calorie allowance by the calorie content per gram of fat: 750 kcal / 9 kcal/gram = 83.33 grams.

The closest answer to 83.33 grams is **875 grams**. However, this answer seems unusually high. It's likely there's an error in the provided options. 

Let's analyze the other options:

* **97 grams:** This option seems more reasonable considering a 2,500 kcal diet.
* **218 grams:** This option is too high.
* **71 grams:** This option is also within a possible range.

**Considering the error in option A and the typical fat intake recommendations, the most likely correct answer is either 97 grams or 71 grams. Without further context or corrected options, it's impossible to definitively determine the single correct answer.**

* **C. Up to 140 mg sodium per serving:** This option represents a higher amount of sodium compared to A and B.
* **D. At least 25% less sodium than the regular food:** This option focuses on a relative reduction in sodium content rather than a specific amount.

According to the FDA, a food labeled as "low sodium" must contain **140 mg or less of sodium per serving**.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<answer>C. Up to 140 mg sodium per serving</answer>

78. The presence of fat in the intestine stimulates cells to release:
A. Gastrin B. Secretin C. Insulin D. Cholecystokinin 

## Step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the question:** The question asks about the hormone released when fat is present in the intestine.

2. **Analyze the options:**
    * **Gastrin:** Primarily stimulates gastric acid secretion in the stomach.
    * **Secretin:**  Primarily stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas.
    * **Insulin:**  Regulates blood sugar levels.
    * **Cholecystokinin (CCK):** Stimulates the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the gallbladder.

3. **Connect the information:** Fat digestion primarily occurs in the small intestine and requires both pancreatic enzymes and bile. 

4. **Choose the correct answer:**  Cholecystokinin (CCK) is the hormone specifically released in response to the presence of fat in the intestine, triggering the release of necessary digestive substances.

<answer>D. Cholecystokinin</answer>

79. One of the key features of andragogy is that adults _____.
A. expect to be assigned an explicit study plan B. want learning that is relevant to their needs C. desire external sources of motivation D. want to learn what others think is important 

The question asks us to identify a key feature of andragogy. Andragogy is the method and practice of teaching adult learners; adult education.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A. expect to be assigned an explicit study plan:** While some structure can be helpful, adults are generally more self-directed in their learning.
* **B. want learning that is relevant to their needs:** Adults have specific goals and experiences. They learn best when they see the value and application of the knowledge.
* **C. desire external sources of motivation:**  Adults are often intrinsically motivated to learn to improve their lives or careers.
* **D. want to learn what others think is important:** Adults prioritize their own needs and interests in learning.

**Therefore, the correct answer is:**

<answer>B. want learning that is relevant to their needs</answer>

80. Which of the following is decreased in alcohol metabolism?
A. Uptake of fatty acids B. Fatty acid synthesis C. Triglyceride formation D. Fatty acid breakdown 

The question asks us to identify a metabolic process that is inhibited during alcohol metabolism. Let's analyze each option:

* **A. Uptake of fatty acids:** Alcohol consumption is known to disrupt normal liver function, often leading to a buildup of fat in the liver. This suggests that fatty acid uptake might actually increase, not decrease.

* **B. Fatty acid synthesis:** Similar to uptake, alcohol's effects on the liver often promote fat storage rather than breakdown. This makes it likely that fatty acid synthesis would also increase.

* **C. Triglyceride formation:** Triglycerides are the storage form of fatty acids. Given the tendency of alcohol to increase fat accumulation in the liver, triglyceride formation would likely be enhanced.

* **D. Fatty acid breakdown:**  Alcohol metabolism prioritizes the breakdown of alcohol itself, shifting the liver's focus away from breaking down other energy sources like fatty acids. This makes fatty acid breakdown the most likely process to be decreased.

**Therefore, the answer is <answer>D. Fatty acid breakdown</answer>.**

81. Which of the following is a potential threat to the internal and external validity of a longitudinal study?
A. Bootstrapping B. Cluster sampling C. Attrition D. Dispersion 

We are presented with a multiple choice question asking us to identify a potential threat to the internal and external validity of a longitudinal study from four options: Bootstrapping, Cluster sampling, Attrition, and Dispersion. Let's analyze each option:

* **A. Bootstrapping:** A resampling technique used to estimate statistics on a population by sampling a dataset with replacement. It doesn't directly threaten the validity of a longitudinal study.
* **B. Cluster sampling:** A sampling technique where the population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected. While it affects the generalizability, it's not a direct threat to internal or external validity in itself.
* **C. Attrition:**  Refers to the loss of participants over time in a longitudinal study. This can lead to biased results if the participants who drop out are systematically different from those who remain, impacting both internal and external validity.
* **D. Dispersion:** Refers to the spread or variability of data. While important for analysis, it doesn't directly threaten the validity of a longitudinal study.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C. Attrition.**

<answer>C</answer>
