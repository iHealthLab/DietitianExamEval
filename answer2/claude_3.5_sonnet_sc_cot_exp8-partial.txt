61. When using a nutrient database to calculate nutrient data for a recipe, a "blank" associated with a nutrient generally means
A. reliable data have not been collected. B. the food contains a negligible amount. C. the food does not contain any amount of that nutrient. D. the amount of the nutrient varies significantly from serving to serving. 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - We're dealing with nutrient databases used for calculating nutrient data in recipes.
   - The question is about the meaning of a "blank" entry for a nutrient in such a database.
   - We have four possible interpretations of what this blank might mean.

2. Analyze the options:
   A. This suggests that data haven't been collected or aren't reliable.
   B. This implies that the amount is so small it's considered negligible.
   C. This states that the nutrient is completely absent from the food.
   D. This indicates high variability in the nutrient's amount between servings.

3. Consider the implications:
   - In nutrient databases, it's important to distinguish between zero, trace amounts, and unknown values.
   - A blank entry is more likely to indicate uncertainty or lack of data rather than a definitive amount.

4. Evaluate each option:
   - Option A seems most plausible as it reflects uncertainty in the data.
   - Option B is less likely as negligible amounts are often reported as "trace" or a very small number.
   - Option C is too definitive for a blank entry; zero amounts are typically reported as "0".
   - Option D might be true in some cases, but variability is usually noted differently.

   - This initiative applies to schools participating in the National School Breakfast Program.
   - The question is about the required percentage of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein.

2. Consider the options:
   A. 1/2 (or 50%)
   B. 1/3 (or approximately 33.3%)
   C. 1/4 (or 25%)
   D. 1/5 (or 20%)

3. Recall information about school breakfast programs:
   - Breakfast is typically considered one of the three main meals of the day.
   - It's generally expected to provide a significant portion of daily nutritional needs, but not as much as lunch or dinner.

4. Apply logical reasoning:
   - 1/2 (50%) seems too high for just breakfast, as it would leave only 50% for the other meals combined.
   - 1/5 (20%) seems too low for a main meal, especially considering the importance placed on school nutrition.
   - 1/4 (25%) is a reasonable amount for one of three main meals, but might be slightly low.
   - 1/3 (33.3%) appears to be the most logical choice, as it represents a substantial portion of daily needs while leaving room for other meals.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on this reasoning, the most likely answer is B. 1/3 of the RDA for protein.

158. Resting energy expenditure (REE) is most affected by
A. body composition. B. physical activity. C. time of day. D. food intake. 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - The question is about factors affecting Resting Energy Expenditure (REE).
   - REE is the amount of energy expended by a person at rest.
   - We are given four options that could potentially affect REE.

2. Analyze each option:
   A. Body composition:
      - This refers to the ratio of fat to lean body mass.
      - Lean body mass (muscles, organs) is metabolically active and requires more energy.

   B. Physical activity:
      - This affects total energy expenditure but not necessarily REE.
      - REE is measured at rest, so physical activity shouldn't directly impact it.

   C. Time of day:
      - There might be slight variations in REE throughout the day due to circadian rhythms.
      - However, these variations are generally small.

   D. Food intake:
      - While eating does increase energy expenditure (thermic effect of food), this is not part of REE.
      - REE is typically measured in a fasted state.

3. Conclusion:
   Among the given options, body composition has the most significant impact on REE. People with more lean body mass (like muscles) tend to have higher REE because these tissues require more energy to maintain, even at rest.

A. Magnesium B. Vitamin D C. Vitamin B12 D. Calcium 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - The question is about the potential masking effect of excessive folate supplementation.
   - We need to identify which nutrient deficiency might be hidden by high folate intake.
   - We have four options: Magnesium, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Calcium.

   - 6 lbs Ã 3 cups/lb = 18 cups in a case

3. Calculate the cost per cup:
   - Cost per case = $41.88
   - Cups per case = 18
   - Cost per cup = $41.88 Ã· 18 = $2.33 per cup

4. Calculate the cost for 1 3/4 cups:
   - 1 cup costs $2.33
   - 3/4 cup costs 3/4 Ã $2.33 = $1.7475

246. What government branch is responsible for yield grades and defining the term "organic" as it relates to farming practices?
A. FDA B. USDA C. NSIP D. NMFS 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - We're looking for a government branch responsible for two things:
     a) Yield grades
     b) Defining the term "organic" in relation to farming practices

2. Consider each option:
   A. FDA (Food and Drug Administration)
   B. USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)
   C. NSIP (National Scrapie Improvement Program)
   D. NMFS (National Marine Fisheries Service)

3. Analyze each option:
   A. FDA: Primarily deals with food safety and drug regulation, not typically involved in grading agricultural products or defining organic standards.
   B. USDA: Responsible for developing and executing federal laws related to farming, forestry, rural economic development, and food.
   C. NSIP: A specific program related to sheep genetics, not a broad agricultural regulatory body.
   D. NMFS: Focuses on marine resources and ecosystems, not land-based agriculture.

4. Reasoning:
   - Yield grades are typically associated with meat quality and are used in the beef industry.
   - The term "organic" as it relates to farming practices is a standardized label that requires certification.
   - The USDA is known to be responsible for both of these functions:
     - They establish yield grades for beef.
     - They manage the National Organic Program, which defines and regulates organic standards.

5. Conclusion:
   Based on this analysis, the correct answer is B. USDA (United States Department of Agriculture).

251. In the receiving process, what step should be taken first?
A. SendÂ items to be placed in storage B. Inspect items against purchase order C. Accept or reject the items D. Inspect items against invoice 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   The question is about the receiving process and asks which step should be taken first.
   We have four options to choose from:
   A. Send items to be placed in storage
   B. Inspect items against purchase order
   C. Accept or reject the items
   D. Inspect items against invoice

2. Consider the logical order of steps in a receiving process:
   - When items arrive, you need to verify what has been received before taking any other action.
   - You can't accept, reject, or store items without first checking what you've received.
   - The purchase order is the original document detailing what was ordered.
   - The invoice is typically checked later in the process, often after items have been received and verified.

3. Analyze each option:
   A. Sending items to storage should not be the first step, as you need to verify the items first.
   B. Inspecting items against the purchase order makes sense as a first step to ensure you received what was ordered.
   C. Accepting or rejecting items can only be done after inspection.
   D. Inspecting against the invoice usually comes later, after verifying the items against the purchase order.

4. Conclusion:
   The logical first step in the receiving process is to inspect the items against the purchase order. This allows you to verify that you've received what was actually ordered before taking any further action.

252. A number 16 scoop will provide which level measurement?
A. 1/4 cup B. 1/2 cup C. 2/3 cup D. 3/4 cup 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - We're dealing with ice cream scoops.
   - The question refers to a "number 16 scoop".
   - We need to determine the volume this scoop will provide.

2. Understand what a "number 16 scoop" means:
   - In the food service industry, scoop sizes are often denoted by numbers.
   - The number represents how many scoops of that size it would take to fill a quart (32 ounces).
   - So, a number 16 scoop means it would take 16 scoops to fill a quart.

3. Calculate the volume of a number 16 scoop:
   - 1 quart = 32 ounces
   - 1 quart = 4 cups
   - If it takes 16 scoops to make a quart, then:
     32 ounces Ã· 16 = 2 ounces per scoop
   - 2 ounces = 1/4 cup

4. Compare this result to the given options:
   A. 1/4 cup
   B. 1/2 cup
   C. 2/3 cup
   D. 3/4 cup

5. Select the correct answer:
   The number 16 scoop provides 1/4 cup measurement.

253. Which of the following is an example of cross-contamination?
A. Using the same surface to cut raw chicken and onions B. Preparing onion rings with wheat-based breading in the dedicated gluten-free fryer C. Using the same spatula to prepare peanut-containing and peanut-free cookies D. Storing allergen-containing foods on the same shelf as allergen-free foods 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the information:
The question is asking about cross-contamination, which occurs when harmful bacteria or allergens are transferred from one food or surface to another.

2. Analyze each option:

A. Using the same surface to cut raw chicken and onions:
- This is a clear example of cross-contamination. Raw chicken can contain harmful bacteria that can be transferred to the onions if cut on the same surface.

B. Preparing onion rings with wheat-based breading in the dedicated gluten-free fryer:
- This is cross-contamination, as it introduces gluten into a fryer meant to be gluten-free.

C. Using the same spatula to prepare peanut-containing and peanut-free cookies:
- This is cross-contamination, as peanut allergens can be transferred from one batch of cookies to another.

D. Storing allergen-containing foods on the same shelf as allergen-free foods:
- While not ideal, simply storing these foods on the same shelf is not necessarily cross-contamination if the foods are properly sealed and separated.

3. Identify the correct answer:
All options except D involve direct contact between allergens or potential contaminants and other foods or surfaces. Option A is the most clear-cut example of cross-contamination involving harmful bacteria.
