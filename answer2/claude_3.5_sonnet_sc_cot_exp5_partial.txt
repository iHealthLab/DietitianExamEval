3. Canned corn has more sodium and less potassium than fresh corn. This is the result of
A. processing. B. enrichment. C. fortification. D. additives. 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - Canned corn has more sodium than fresh corn
   - Canned corn has less potassium than fresh corn
   - We need to determine what causes these differences

2. Consider each option:

   A. Processing:
   - Processing involves the methods used to prepare and preserve food
   - Canning is a form of processing
   - During canning, salt (sodium) is often added as a preservative
   - The canning process can also lead to some loss of nutrients, including potassium

   B. Enrichment:
   - Enrichment is the addition of nutrients that were lost during processing
   - This typically involves adding back vitamins and minerals
   - Enrichment wouldn't explain the increase in sodium or decrease in potassium

   C. Fortification:
   - Fortification is the addition of nutrients that weren't originally present in the food
   - Like enrichment, this wouldn't explain the sodium increase or potassium decrease

   D. Additives:
   - Additives are substances added to food for various purposes
   - While sodium could be considered an additive, this option doesn't explain the decrease in potassium

3. Conclusion:
   The most comprehensive explanation for both the increase in sodium and decrease in potassium is processing. The canning process often involves adding salt (increasing sodium) and can result in some nutrient loss (decreasing potassium).

   A. "expect to be assigned an explicit study plan"
      - This is more characteristic of pedagogy (teaching children) rather than andragogy.
   
   B. "want learning that is relevant to their needs"
      - This aligns with adult learning principles, as adults typically seek practical and applicable knowledge.
   
   C. "desire external sources of motivation"
      - Adults are generally more internally motivated, so this is less likely to be a key feature of andragogy.
   
   D. "want to learn what others think is important"
      - Adults usually prefer to make their own decisions about what to learn based on their needs and experiences.

3. Consider the principles of andragogy:
   - Adults are self-directed learners.
   - They bring life experiences to learning situations.
   - They are problem-centered and seek immediate application of knowledge.
   - They are internally motivated.

4. Match the principles with the options:
   Option B best aligns with these principles, as adults typically seek learning that is relevant and applicable to their current needs and situations.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

80. Which of the following is decreased in alcohol metabolism?
A. Uptake of fatty acids B. Fatty acid synthesis C. Triglyceride formation D. Fatty acid breakdown 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - The question is about the effects of alcohol metabolism on various lipid-related processes.
   - We need to identify which process is decreased during alcohol metabolism.
   - The options given are related to fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism.

2. Consider the effects of alcohol metabolism on lipid processes:
   - Alcohol metabolism primarily occurs in the liver.
   - When alcohol is being metabolized, it becomes a priority for the liver.
   - Alcohol metabolism produces NADH, which affects the redox state of the liver.

3. Analyze each option:
   A. Uptake of fatty acids: 
      - Alcohol actually increases fatty acid uptake by the liver.

   B. Fatty acid synthesis: 
      - Alcohol metabolism increases fatty acid synthesis due to the excess NADH produced.

   C. Triglyceride formation: 
      - Alcohol consumption leads to increased triglyceride formation in the liver.

   D. Fatty acid breakdown: 
      - Alcohol metabolism inhibits fatty acid oxidation (breakdown) in the liver.

4. Conclusion:
   Based on this analysis, the process that is decreased during alcohol metabolism is fatty acid breakdown (oxidation).

1. Summarize the available information:
   - We're looking for a potential threat to both internal and external validity
   - The context is a longitudinal study
   - We have four options to choose from

2. Understand what a longitudinal study is:
   - A longitudinal study is a research design that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of time

3. Evaluate each option:

   A. Bootstrapping:
   - This is a statistical technique for estimating the sampling distribution of an estimator
   - It doesn't directly threaten the validity of a longitudinal study

   B. Cluster sampling:
   - This is a sampling method where groups of subjects are selected
   - While it can affect representativeness, it's not specifically a threat to longitudinal studies

   C. Attrition:
   - This refers to the loss of participants over the course of a study
   - In longitudinal studies, participants may drop out over time
   - This can threaten both internal validity (by introducing bias) and external validity (by reducing generalizability)

   D. Dispersion:
   - This typically refers to the spread of data points
   - It's not inherently a threat to the validity of longitudinal studies

4. Conclusion:
   Based on this analysis, attrition is the most significant threat to both internal and external validity in longitudinal studies.

82. If 100 patients with a disease are tested but only 96 test positive for the disease, that means the test has a ________ of 96%.
A. sensitivity B. specificity C. positive predictive value D. negative predictive value 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - There are 100 patients with a disease
   - 96 out of these 100 patients test positive
   - We need to determine what this 96% represents

2. Understand the given options:
   A. Sensitivity
   B. Specificity
   C. Positive predictive value
   D. Negative predictive value

3. Define the relevant terms:
   - Sensitivity: The proportion of true positive cases that are correctly identified by the test
   - Specificity: The proportion of true negative cases that are correctly identified by the test
   - Positive predictive value: The proportion of positive test results that are truly positive
   - Negative predictive value: The proportion of negative test results that are truly negative

4. Analyze the situation:
   - We know that all 100 patients actually have the disease
   - 96 out of 100 patients with the disease tested positive
   - This means the test correctly identified 96% of the true positive cases

5. Match the analysis with the definitions:
   - This scenario perfectly fits the definition of sensitivity
   - Sensitivity = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)
   - In this case: 96 / 100 = 96%

6. Conclusion:
   The correct answer is sensitivity, as it represents the proportion of true positive cases (patients with the disease) that the test correctly identified.

83. Which of the following is a typical characteristic of olive oil that is extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed?
A. Stronger color intensity B. Stronger aroma C. Lower content of free fatty acids D. Watery 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - We're discussing olive oil that has been extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed.
   - This implies that the oil has undergone multiple extraction processes.
   - We need to determine a typical characteristic of such oil.

2. Consider each option:

   A. Stronger color intensity:
   - Multiple pressings typically extract more pigments from the olives.
   - This could lead to a stronger color in the final product.

   B. Stronger aroma:
   - Aroma compounds are usually most prevalent in the first pressing.
   - Subsequent pressings are less likely to increase aroma intensity.

   C. Lower content of free fatty acids:
   - Free fatty acids are a measure of oil quality.
   - Multiple pressings and processing steps tend to increase free fatty acid content, not lower it.

   D. Watery:
   - Olive oil is hydrophobic (doesn't mix with water).
   - Multiple pressings don't typically introduce water into the oil.

3. Analyze and conclude:
   - Option A seems the most logical choice.
   - Multiple pressings extract more pigments, leading to stronger color intensity.
   - The other options are either unlikely or contrary to what we would expect from this process.

Therefore, the most typical characteristic of olive oil that has been extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed is:

<answer>A. Stronger color intensity</answer>

84. Retrogradation, which occurs in starches, can be defined as
A. a reforming of hydrogen bonds into crystalline regions as the starch paste is held. B. a decreased swelling of the starch granules as sugar competes with starch for water. C. the breakdown of a starch paste when acid is added at the beginning of the cooking period. D. swelling of starch granules upon exposure to heat. 

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Summarize the available information:
   - The question is about retrogradation in starches.
   - We need to identify the correct definition of retrogradation from the given options.

2. Analyze each option:

   A. "a reforming of hydrogen bonds into crystalline regions as the starch paste is held"
      - This describes a process where starch molecules realign and form crystalline structures.
      - This is consistent with the general understanding of retrogradation.

   B. "a decreased swelling of the starch granules as sugar competes with starch for water"
      - This describes a different process related to sugar's effect on starch gelatinization.
      - It doesn't match the concept of retrogradation.

   C. "the breakdown of a starch paste when acid is added at the beginning of the cooking period"
      - This describes acid hydrolysis of starch, not retrogradation.

   D. "swelling of starch granules upon exposure to heat"
      - This describes gelatinization, which is a different process from retrogradation.

3. Identify the correct answer:
   - Retrogradation is indeed the process where starch molecules realign and form crystalline structures after gelatinization.
   - This occurs when a starch paste is cooled or aged.

4. Conclusion:
   The correct definition of retrogradation is given in option A.
