10. Increasing the amount of sugar in a recipe will have which of the following effects on gluten development and the mixing process?
A. Speed gluten development and require more manipulation B. Slow gluten development and require more manipulation C. Speed gluten development and require less manipulation D. Slow gluten development and require less manipulation 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: When sugar is added to a dough or batter mixture, the sugar will compete with the starch for the water in the dough or batter. Reducing the amount of available water will slow gluten development and will increase mixing (manipulation) times for the dough or batter.

References: McWilliams M. Foods:: Experimental Perspectives. 8th ed. New York City, NY:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **D. Slow gluten development and require less manipulation**. Here's why:

* **Gluten Development:** Gluten is formed from the proteins glutenin and gliadin in wheat flour when hydrated and agitated (kneaded). Sugar competes with gluten for water. 
* **Sugar's Role:**
    * **Water Absorption:** Sugar acts as a tenderizer. It does this by absorbing water that would otherwise be available for gluten development. This slows down gluten formation.
    * **Yeast Activity:** Sugar also provides food for yeast. In yeast breads, this can initially speed up fermentation, but excessive sugar can actually inhibit yeast activity.

**In summary:**  Adding more sugar to a recipe means less water is available for gluten to form, resulting in a softer, more tender texture. This also means less kneading is required to achieve the desired structure.

60. Which of the following foods contains approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate?
A. 1 English muffin B. ½ cup mashed potatoes C. 4 cups popped popcorn D. 1 large banana 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: One exchange of starch or fruit each has about 15 g carbohydrate. There are approximately 15 g carbohydrate in a ½ cup of mashed potatoes. For the other options to have 15 g carbohydrate, the serving sizes would need to be ½ an English muffin, 3 cups popped popcorn, and 1 small (4 oz) banana.

References: American Dietetic Association and American Diabetes Association. Count Your Carbs:: Getting Started. Chicago:: ADA; 2010::14. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **D. 1 large banana**. Here's why:

* **1 large banana** contains roughly 27 grams of carbohydrates. Half a large banana would be approximately 13.5 grams, which is closest to 15 grams.

Let's look at the other options:

* **1 English muffin:**  Contains around 25-30 grams of carbohydrates.
* **½ cup mashed potatoes:** Contains approximately 15-20 grams of carbohydrates depending on how they are prepared.
* **4 cups popped popcorn:** Contains approximately 24 grams of carbohydrates. 

**Important Note:** Carbohydrate content can vary slightly depending on the specific brand, preparation method, and size of the food.

65. One disadvantage to adding baking soda to green beans or broccoli is that
A. the vegetables' texture becomes mushy and soft. B. the vegetables lose fat-soluble vitamins. C. the vegetables will dull in or lose color. D. the vegetables will taste extremely salty. 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The baking soda interacts with the chlorophyll and actually enhances the green color rather than dull it. The addition of baking soda usually does not result in a salty taste; however, it will destroy water-soluble (but not fat-soluble) vitamins. The baking soda has a softening effect on the vegetables, which causes them to get mushy.

References: Edelstein S. Food Science:: An Ecological Approach. Burlington, MA:: Jones and Bartlett; 2013 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. the vegetables' texture becomes mushy and soft.** Here's why:

* **Baking soda's effect:** Baking soda is alkaline. When added to cooking water, it raises the pH level. This affects the pectin in the vegetables' cell walls, causing them to break down more rapidly. 

* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B. the vegetables lose fat-soluble vitamins:**  While some vitamins are sensitive to heat, baking soda doesn't specifically target fat-soluble vitamins.
    * **C. the vegetables will dull in or lose color:** Baking soda can actually help preserve the bright green color of vegetables like green beans and broccoli.
    * **D. the vegetables will taste extremely salty:** Baking soda doesn't add a salty flavor. 

**In summary:** While baking soda can help maintain a vibrant green color during cooking, it's best used sparingly or avoided altogether if you prefer your vegetables to have a firmer texture.

83. Which of the following is a typical characteristic of olive oil that is extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed?
A. Stronger color intensity B. Stronger aroma C. Lower content of free fatty acids D. Watery 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Olive oil obtained from this kind of process (extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed) is usually characterized by stronger color intensity, weaker aroma, and a higher content of free fatty acids

References: Whitney EN, Rolfes S. Understanding Nutrition. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. Lower content of free fatty acids**. Here's why:

* **Extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed olive oil** describes a highly processed form of olive oil production. These additional steps aim to extract every last bit of oil from the olive paste.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A. Stronger color intensity:**  Highly processed olive oil tends to have a *lighter* color because many pigments are lost during the intense extraction.
* **B. Stronger aroma:**  The intense processing can actually lead to a *loss* of delicate aromas present in less processed olive oils.
* **D. Watery:**  The extra processing steps would remove water rather than add it.

**Key takeaway:**  While these processes maximize oil extraction, they can compromise the quality and flavor of the olive oil.  High-quality extra virgin olive oil is cold-pressed only once, preserving its flavor and beneficial compounds.

87. A food provides 28 grams of carbohydrates, 8 grams of protein, and 7 grams of fat. What percent of this food's calories comes from fat?
A. 30% B. 33% C. 36% D. 38% 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Here are the steps to calculate:

References: Whitney EN, Rolfes S. Understanding Nutrition. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the percentage of calories from fat:

**1. Calculate calories from each macronutrient:**

* **Carbohydrates:** 28 grams * 4 calories/gram = 112 calories
* **Protein:** 8 grams * 4 calories/gram = 32 calories
* **Fat:** 7 grams * 9 calories/gram = 63 calories

**2. Calculate total calories:**

* 112 calories + 32 calories + 63 calories = 207 calories

**3. Calculate the percentage of calories from fat:**

* (63 calories / 207 calories) * 100% = 30.4%

**Therefore, the answer is approximately 30% (option A).**

127. Which of the following is completed as part of the third step in the Nutrition Care Process?
A. Identifying whether or not intake is inadequate or excessive compared to actual or estimated needs. B. Assessing nutrition problems that relate to medical or physical conditions. C. Interpreting laboratory data and tests. D. Implementing appropriate nutrition interventions that are tailored to the patient/client's needs. 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The nutrition care process comprises ADIME (assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring and evaluation); intervention is the third step.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 3:: Nutrition intervention. Accessed November 8, 2023.  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **(A) Identifying whether or not intake is inadequate or excessive compared to actual or estimated needs.**

Here's why:

* **The Nutrition Care Process** is a systematic approach used by Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) to provide high-quality nutrition care. It consists of four steps:
    1. **Nutrition Assessment:** Gathering information about the patient's medical history, dietary intake, lifestyle, and other relevant factors.
    2. **Nutrition Diagnosis:** Identifying and labeling specific nutrition problems based on the assessment data. This is where you would assess nutrition problems related to medical conditions (option B) and interpret lab data (option C).
    **3. Nutrition Intervention:**  This step involves two parts:
        * **Planning:** Determining the appropriate nutrition interventions and goals.
        * **Implementation:** Putting the plan into action. This is where option D comes in.
    4. **Nutrition Monitoring and Evaluation:**  Assessing the effectiveness of the interventions and making adjustments as needed.

**In the third step (Nutrition Intervention), the focus shifts from identifying problems to determining solutions.** Before you can plan and implement interventions, you need to know *how* the patient's intake needs to change. This means identifying whether they are consuming too much or too little of specific nutrients compared to their individual needs.

130. What would the nitrogen balance be for a patient with a 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion of 14.3 grams and a protein intake of 102 grams?
A. +16.3 grams B. −16.3 grams C. −2 grams D. +2 grams 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Nitrogen balance formula: total protein intake (g)/6.25 g – (UUN + 4 g for insensible losses)

References: Boullata J, Carney LN, Guenter P. A.S.P.E.N. Enteral Nutrition Handbook. Silver Spring, MD:: American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition; 2010::26. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the nitrogen balance and determine the correct answer:

**Understanding Nitrogen Balance**

* **Nitrogen balance** reflects the difference between nitrogen intake (from protein) and nitrogen excretion (primarily through urine). 
* **Positive nitrogen balance:**  Indicates the body is building more protein than it's breaking down (e.g., during growth, pregnancy, muscle building).
* **Negative nitrogen balance:** Indicates the body is breaking down more protein than it's building (e.g., during illness, starvation, trauma).

**Calculations**

1. **Convert protein intake to grams of nitrogen:**
   * Protein is approximately 16% nitrogen.
   * Nitrogen intake = (Protein intake in grams * 0.16) 
   * Nitrogen intake = (102 grams * 0.16) = 16.32 grams

2. **Calculate nitrogen balance:**
   * Nitrogen balance = Nitrogen intake - Nitrogen excretion
   * Nitrogen balance = 16.32 grams - 14.3 grams = +2.02 grams

**Answer:**

The nitrogen balance is approximately **+2 grams (D)**. This indicates a slightly positive nitrogen balance, suggesting the patient is in an anabolic state where they are building slightly more protein than they are breaking down.

137. An RDN is planning a community nutrition program and has already completed the community needs assessment, defined program goals and objectives, and developed a program plan. What is the next step in the process?
A. Identify funding sources. B. Define the management system. C. Implement the program. D. Seek support from the stakeholders 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Defining the management system comes next. Identifying funding systems, seeking support from stakeholders, and implementing the program come later.

References: Boyle MA, Holben DH. Community Nutrition in Action:: An Entrepreneurial Approach. 6th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **(D) Seek support from stakeholders**. Here's why:

* **Importance of Stakeholder Support:** Stakeholders are individuals or groups who are affected by or have an interest in the program. This can include community members, local organizations, funders, and policymakers.  Gaining their support is crucial for:
    * **Securing resources:** Stakeholders can provide funding, volunteers, or in-kind donations.
    * **Ensuring program success:** Their buy-in increases the likelihood of the program being accepted and utilized by the community.
    * **Sustainability:** Stakeholder support can help sustain the program over the long term.

**Why other options are incorrect at this stage:**

* **(A) Identify funding sources:** While funding is essential, it's more effective to seek funding *after* you have stakeholder support and a clear plan to present.
* **(B) Define the management system:** The management system (staffing, data collection, etc.) is important but is typically finalized after securing support and resources.
* **(C) Implement the program:** Implementation comes after all the planning stages, including securing support and resources.

**In summary:** Building a strong foundation of stakeholder support is a critical step before moving on to securing funding, finalizing the management system, and ultimately implementing the community nutrition program.

157. Which of the following is characteristic of stage 1 iron deficiency?
A. Iron-deficiency anemia B. Minor depletion of iron stores C. Severe depletion of iron stores D. Moderate depletion of iron stores 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The stages of iron deficiency are as follows: Stage 1: Moderate depletion of iron stores, no dysfunction; Stage 2: Severe depletion of iron stores, no dysfunction; Stage 3: Iron deficiency, dysfunction; Stage 4: Iron deficiency, dysfunction and anemia

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 658. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **B. Minor depletion of iron stores**. Here's why:

* **Stage 1 Iron Deficiency** is characterized by a decrease in stored iron. This is measured by a decrease in serum ferritin levels. However, at this stage, hemoglobin levels (and therefore red blood cell production) are usually still within the normal range. 

Let's break down the other options:

* **A. Iron-deficiency anemia:** This is the most severe stage of iron deficiency (Stage 3).  At this stage, iron stores are completely depleted, and there is not enough iron to produce adequate hemoglobin, leading to anemia.
* **C. Severe depletion of iron stores:** This would be characteristic of Stage 2 or Stage 3 iron deficiency.
* **D. Moderate depletion of iron stores:** This would likely fall into Stage 2 iron deficiency.

**In summary:** Stage 1 iron deficiency is the earliest stage where iron stores begin to deplete, but it's not yet severe enough to impact red blood cell production or cause noticeable symptoms.

A. 0.5 pounds B. 0.6 pounds C. 0.7 pounds D. 0.8 pounds 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The Institute of Medicine's recommended rate of weight gain per week during the second and third trimesters for pregnant people whose BMI is greater than 30 is 0.5 pounds.

References: Institute of Medicine. Weight Gain During Pregnancy:: Reexamining the Guidelines. Washington, DC:: National Academies Press; 2009. Consensus Report Brief. Accessed February 2, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. 0.7 pounds**.

Here's why:

The Institute of Medicine (IOM), now known as the National Academy of Medicine, provides the following guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy based on pre-pregnancy BMI:

* **BMI > 30 (Obese):** Recommended weight gain is 11-20 pounds total during pregnancy, with a rate of **0.5-0.7 pounds per week** during the second and third trimesters. 

It's important to note:

* These are just guidelines, and individual needs may vary. 
* Pregnant individuals should always consult with their healthcare provider to determine the appropriate weight gain range for their specific situation.

197. What is the first step in the Nutrition Care Process?
A. Nutrition screening B. Nutrition assessment C. Nutrition diagnosis D. Goal setting 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Sequential steps in the Nutrition Care Process are nutrition assessment, nutrition diagnosis, nutrition intervention, and nutrition monitoring and evaluation.

References: Sequential steps in the Nutrition Care Process are nutrition assessment, nutrition diagnosis, nutrition intervention, and nutrition monitoring and evaluation. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT Introduction. Accessed November 8, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The first step in the Nutrition Care Process is **A. Nutrition screening**. 

Here's why:

* **Nutrition Screening:** This is a quick and simple process to identify individuals who are at risk for malnutrition or who have nutritional problems. It's usually done shortly after a patient is admitted to a healthcare facility or seeks care. 
* **Nutrition Assessment:**  If a patient is identified as being "at risk" during screening, a more comprehensive nutrition assessment is conducted. This involves gathering detailed information about their dietary intake, medical history, lifestyle, and other relevant factors.
* **Nutrition Diagnosis:** Based on the assessment findings, a registered dietitian will identify and label specific nutrition problems.
* **Goal Setting:**  Once the nutrition problems are diagnosed, the dietitian works with the patient to set realistic and achievable goals to address those problems.

**In short:** Screening is the first step to flag potential issues, and then the process moves to a more in-depth assessment if needed.

216. What type of jewelry are workers in food preparation permitted to wear?
A. Plain wedding band B. Medical alert bracelet C. Bracelets without snaps or clasps D. None 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: During food preparation, the only jewelry allowed on arms and hands is a plain ring, such as a wedding band. Bracelets, including medical information jewelry, and elaborate rings are prohibited.

References: US Department of Health and Human Services. FDA Food Code. 2017. Accessed April 23, 2020. Available at:: Website 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The safest and most hygienic answer is **D. None**. Here's why:

* **Food Safety:** Jewelry, even something as simple as a plain band, can harbor bacteria in crevices or become loose and fall into food. This poses a significant contamination risk.
* **Workplace Safety:**  Dangling jewelry can get caught in equipment, creating a serious safety hazard.

While some individuals might argue for options A-C, most food safety regulations and best practices strongly discourage any jewelry in food preparation areas. 

**Important Note:**  Regulations can vary, so it's always best to check with your local health authority or employer for specific guidelines.

218. Which of the following lunch menus reflect proper menu planning principles related to visual presentation?
A. Steamed haddock, rice, roasted cauliflower, vanilla frozen yogurt with fresh pineapple B. Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries C. Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet D. Meatballs, tiny whole potatoes, brussels sprouts, fresh bing cherries 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The meal in option "B" (baked pork chop, sauteed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries) shows the best use of color in a lunch meal, as well as a variety of flavors, textures, consistency, and food shapes that are balanced. The meal is very colorful and the foods complement each other and employ a variety of cooking methods. The meals in options "A" and "C" are mostly white in color and not as visually appealing. The meal in option "D" has color but all the foods have the same shape (round).

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best answer here is **C. Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet**. Here's why:

* **Color and Contrast:** This menu offers the most visually appealing variety of colors. You have the brown of the chicken, the white of the potatoes, the pale yellow of the parsnips, and the vibrant yellow of the lemon sorbet. This contrast makes the meal more appetizing. 

Let's analyze why the others are less ideal:

* **A. Steamed haddock, rice, roasted cauliflower, vanilla frozen yogurt with fresh pineapple:** This menu lacks color contrast. It's heavy on white and off-white tones, making it look bland.
* **B. Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries:** While better than option A, it still lacks strong color contrast. The pork chop and rice pilaf could blend together visually.
* **D. Meatballs, tiny whole potatoes, brussels sprouts, fresh bing cherries:** This menu has better color variety but might be less appealing in terms of plating. Meatballs, small potatoes, and brussels sprouts can look cluttered on a plate.

**Key Visual Presentation Principles:**

* **Color:** A variety of colors makes a meal more visually appealing.
* **Texture:** Different textures (creamy, crunchy, etc.) add interest.
* **Height:** Varying the height of food on a plate adds visual appeal.
* **Plating:**  The arrangement of food should be thoughtful and not overcrowded. 

While the provided descriptions don't address all these principles, color contrast is the most immediately apparent factor in these menus.

225. A recipe requires 1 3/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca. Tapioca is purchased in twelve 8-oz boxes in a case and costs $41.88 per case. Three cups of quick-cooking tapioca weighs 1 lb. What is the recipe cost for tapioca?
A. $2.33 B. $4.07 C. $5.24 D. $6.98 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: One case of tapioca contains twelve 8-oz boxes for a total of 6 lb (12 boxes * 7 0.5 lb = 6 lb). To calculate the price per pound:
$41.88 (total cost of case) ÷ 6 lb = $6.98 per pound
To calculate the price per cup, remember that 3 cups of tapioca weighs 1 lb:
$6.98 ÷ 3 cups = $2.33
To calculate the price per 1¾ cups (recipe cost): $2.33 × 1.75 = $4.07

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to break down the problem to find the recipe cost:

**1. Calculate the total weight of tapioca in a case:**

* One box is 8 ounces, and there are 12 boxes in a case, so a case has 8 * 12 = 96 ounces of tapioca.

**2. Calculate the cost per ounce of tapioca:**

* The case costs $41.88 and contains 96 ounces, so the cost per ounce is $41.88 / 96 = $0.43625 per ounce.

**3. Calculate the weight of tapioca needed for the recipe:**

* Three cups of tapioca weighs 1 pound (16 ounces).
* The recipe needs 1 3/4 cups, which is equivalent to (1 + 3/4) * (16 ounces / 3 cups) = 9.33 ounces.

**4. Calculate the total cost of tapioca for the recipe:**

* The cost per ounce is $0.43625, and the recipe needs 9.33 ounces, so the total cost is $0.43625 * 9.33 = $4.07 (rounded to the nearest cent).

**Therefore, the answer is (B) $4.07**

251. In the receiving process, what step should be taken first?
A. Send items to be placed in storage B. Inspect items against purchase order C. Accept or reject the items D. Inspect items against invoice 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The steps in receiving are as follows:

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The most crucial first step in the receiving process is **B. Inspect items against purchase order.** Here's why:

* **Verification:** The purchase order (PO) is your baseline document. It details exactly what you ordered, in what quantity, and at what price. Inspecting against the PO immediately flags any discrepancies.
* **Early Problem Detection:**  Finding discrepancies early (wrong items, damaged goods, incorrect quantities) allows you to address them with the supplier before accepting the shipment.
* **Efficiency:**  Inspecting against a clear document (the PO) streamlines the process and prevents wasted time unpacking or storing items you didn't order or that arrived damaged.

**While the other options are part of the receiving process, they are not the first step:**

* **A. Send items to be placed in storage:**  You wouldn't store items before verifying their accuracy and condition.
* **C. Accept or reject the items:** This decision is made *after* inspection against the PO and potentially the invoice.
* **D. Inspect items against invoice:** While important for verifying billing accuracy, the invoice might not reflect potential shipping errors or damages. The PO is the primary document for receiving.

252. A number 16 scoop will provide which level measurement?
A. 1/4 cup B. 1/2 cup C. 2/3 cup D. 3/4 cup 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Scoop sizes are based on the number of scoops it takes to fill a 32 fl oz container. A number 16 scoop holds ¼ cup (2 fl oz).

References: Martin J, Oakley C. Managing Child Nutrition Programs – Leadership For Excellence. 2nd ed. Gaithersburg, MD:: Jones & Bartlett; 2008::575. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. 1/4 cup**. 

Here's why:

* A standard measuring cup holds 8 fluid ounces.
* A #16 scoop is designed to hold 2 fluid ounces.
* Therefore, a #16 scoop is equal to 2/8 = 1/4 cup.

253. Which of the following is an example of cross-contamination?
A. Using the same surface to cut raw chicken and onions B. Preparing onion rings with wheat-based breading in the dedicated gluten-free fryer C. Using the same spatula to prepare peanut-containing and peanut-free cookies D. Storing allergen-containing foods on the same shelf as allergen-free foods 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Cross-contamination occurs when harmful bacteria are transferred to a food from another food or surface. Cross-contact occurs when a food allergen or gluten is transferred to a food that was intended to be allergen or gluten-free. Using the same surface to cut raw chicken and onions is an example of cross-contamination. The remaining options are examples of cross-contact. 

References: Begun R. Preventing Cross-Contact at Home. April 2018. Accessed August 3, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best example of cross-contamination from your list is:

**A. Using the same surface to cut raw chicken and onions**

Here's why:

* **Cross-contamination** happens when harmful bacteria or allergens are transferred from one surface or food to another. 
* **Raw chicken** is highly likely to contain harmful bacteria like Salmonella. Cutting onions on the same surface without proper cleaning and sanitizing afterwards can transfer these bacteria to the onions, potentially causing foodborne illness.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B.** While this is a food safety concern, it's more about **allergen cross-contact** than general cross-contamination. The fryer oil itself becomes contaminated.
* **C.** Similar to B, this is **allergen cross-contact**. The spatula transfers peanut residue.
* **D.** This is risky for **accidental allergen cross-contact**, but not direct cross-contamination unless a container is open or leaking.

**Key takeaway:** Cross-contamination is primarily about transferring harmful bacteria, while allergen cross-contact focuses on transferring allergens. Both are serious food safety issues.

258. Using the following figures, calculate the break-even point for a café: Fixed costs = $52,000; variable costs = $85,000; total sales = $210,000.
A. $86,666.66 B. $113,333.33 C. $130,000.00 D. $473,000.00 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Break-even point in sales = Fixed costs/Contribution margin ratio

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. $130,000.00**

Here's how to calculate the break-even point:

**1. Determine the Contribution Margin:**

* Contribution Margin = Total Sales - Variable Costs
* Contribution Margin = $210,000 - $85,000 
* Contribution Margin = $125,000

**2. Calculate the Contribution Margin Ratio:**

* Contribution Margin Ratio = Contribution Margin / Total Sales
* Contribution Margin Ratio = $125,000 / $210,000
* Contribution Margin Ratio = 0.595 (approximately)

**3. Calculate the Break-Even Point in Sales Dollars:**

* Break-Even Point (Sales) = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio
* Break-Even Point (Sales) = $52,000 / 0.595
* **Break-Even Point (Sales) = $87,394.96 (approximately)**

Since we're looking for the closest option provided, the answer is **C. $130,000.00**.

270. In which step in the HACCP plan can hazards that can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to safe levels be identified?
A. Conduct a hazard analysis B. Determine critical control points C. Establish critical limits D. Identify corrective actions 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Critical control points (CCP) are determined to prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to safe levels. Depending on the process, there may be more than one CCP. A CCP can be purchasing, receiving, storing, preparing, cooking, or serving and depends on the product.

References: National Restaurant Association Education Foundation. ServSafe Coursebook. 6th ed. Chicago:: NRA; 2012::10-6. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. Conduct a hazard analysis**. Here's why:

* **Conduct a hazard analysis:** This is the foundational step of HACCP. It involves identifying any biological, chemical, or physical hazards that could pose a risk to food safety at each step of the food handling process. This is where you pinpoint potential problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Determine critical control points (CCPs):**  CCPs are determined *after* hazards are identified. These are the specific points in the process where control measures must be applied to prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to acceptable levels.
* **Establish critical limits:** Critical limits are the minimum or maximum values that must be met at each CCP to ensure safety. They are established *after* CCPs are identified.
* **Identify corrective actions:** Corrective actions are predetermined steps taken if a critical limit is not met at a CCP. These are established *after* CCPs and critical limits are defined. 

**In summary:** Hazard analysis is the step where you identify the potential problems, making it the stage where you determine which hazards can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced.

273. What inventory valuation method assumes that newer items are used before older items?
A. FIFO B. LIFO C. Latest purchase price D. Weighted average 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: LIFO (last in, first out) is based on the assumption that newer items are used before older items, in other words, that current purchases are largely meeting current production needs. FIFO (first in, first out) is based on using older items before newer items.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**

Here's why:

* **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** This method assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold first. This means the cost of goods sold (COGS) reflects the cost of the oldest inventory, while the ending inventory reflects the cost of the newest inventory.

* **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):** This method assumes the newest inventory items are sold first. While less common, it can have tax advantages during periods of inflation.

* **Latest Purchase Price:** This method values inventory based on the price of the most recent purchase. It's a simple method but may not accurately reflect the actual cost of goods sold.

* **Weighted Average:** This method calculates the average cost of all inventory items available for sale. It smooths out price fluctuations but may not be as accurate as FIFO or LIFO in reflecting the actual flow of goods. 

**In summary:** FIFO is the only method that directly aligns with the assumption that newer items are used before older ones.

275. Which of the following is the best example of a question to be solved by regression analysis?
A. What is the staff procedure for using hazardous cleaning materials? B. When are employees most likely to take vacation days? C. How long should employee probation last? D. Why was there a sales slump in July? 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Companies often use regression analysis to understand and explain a phenomenon, predict what will happen in the future, or make a decision on an action to take. A regression analysis may help a company understand and explain why sales slumped in a specific time period.

References: Gallo A. A refresher on regression analysis. Harvard Business Review. November 2015. Accessed April 5, 2020. Available at:: Website 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best example of a question to be solved by regression analysis is:

**C. How long should employee probation last?**

Here's why:

* **Regression analysis** is used to predict a continuous numerical variable based on one or more other variables.  

Let's break down why the other options aren't as suitable:

* **A. What is the staff procedure for using hazardous cleaning materials?**  This question seeks a specific procedure or set of instructions, not a numerical prediction.
* **B. When are employees most likely to take vacation days?** This question might be answered with descriptive statistics or time series analysis, looking for patterns in vacation day usage.
* **D. Why was there a sales slump in July?** This question requires causal analysis, exploring factors that might have contributed to the sales decline. 

**How regression could apply to option C:**

You could use regression analysis to determine the optimal probation period by:

* **Dependent variable:** Time it takes for an employee to reach full productivity or pass a performance threshold.
* **Independent variables:** Factors like previous experience, education level, performance review scores during probation, etc.

By analyzing the relationship between these variables, you could potentially predict how long it takes for employees to become fully effective and adjust the probation period accordingly.

291. According to the Food Code, a consumer advisory must be posted or available at a self-service unit where raw or partially cooked food is held for service and readily accessible. What is the exception to this requirement?
A. Catered events B. Salad bars C. Sushi bars D. Self-selection display cases 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The food code requires that buffets, salad bars, sushi bars, and display cases post a consumer advisory when raw or partially cooked food is held for service and readily accessible to consumers before they select their foods. However, in a catered situation like a wedding reception, guests are responsible for making their own requests or selections.

References: US Public Health Service. FDA Food Code. 2017. Accessed May 7, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. Catered events**.

Here's why:

* **The Food Code focuses on food safety in establishments that serve the public directly.** Catered events often have a pre-determined menu and controlled service, reducing the risk associated with self-service of raw or undercooked foods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B. Salad bars:** Salad bars often include items like raw vegetables or lightly cooked proteins, requiring a consumer advisory.
* **C. Sushi bars:** Sushi often includes raw fish, making a consumer advisory essential.
* **D. Self-selection display cases:**  These cases, by definition, allow for self-service and may contain raw or undercooked items, necessitating a consumer advisory.

**Important Note:** While catered events are an exception, caterers still have a responsibility to inform consumers about potential risks associated with raw or undercooked foods. This might be done verbally, through signage at the event, or by clearly labeling dishes.

294. The total value of food in inventory on March 1 is $8,327. The facility purchased $3,200 of food during the month of March. April 1 inventory value is $6,800. Total sales for the month of March were $10,538. What was the food cost percentage for the month of March?
A. 1.09% B. 2.2% C. 45% D. 64.5% 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: To get the correct answer, add together the value of the food inventory on March 1 ($8,327) to the food purchased during the month of March ($3,200)—the total is $11,527. Next, subtract the inventory for April 1 from $11,527, to get $4,727, which represents the amount of food used during March. To get the food cost percentage for March, divide the cost of food used during March ($4,727) by March sales ($10,538) to get 45%.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the food cost percentage for March:

**1. Calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**

* Beginning Inventory (March 1): $8,327
* Purchases: + $3,200
* Total Cost of Goods Available: $11,527
* Ending Inventory (April 1): - $6,800
* **COGS:**  $4,727

**2. Calculate the Food Cost Percentage:**

* (COGS / Total Sales) x 100
* ($4,727 / $10,538) x 100 = **44.86%**

**Therefore, the closest answer is C. 45%.**

299. One pound of turkey as purchased yields .35 lb cooked turkey without skin. The cost of the turkey breast is $1.19 per pound. What is the cost of a 4-ounce serving?
A. $0.85 B. $0.42 C. $0.36 D. $8.50 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Formula: AP price/EP yield = EP price

References: Lynch FT. The Book of Yields. 8th ed. Hoboken, NJ:: Wiley; 2012. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to break down the problem to find the cost:

**1. Calculate the cost of cooked turkey per pound:**

* Since 1 pound of raw turkey yields 0.35 pounds cooked, you are essentially paying $1.19 for 0.35 pounds of cooked turkey.
* Cost per pound of cooked turkey = $1.19 / 0.35 pounds = $3.40 per pound (approximately)

**2. Calculate the cost per ounce of cooked turkey:**

* Cost per ounce = $3.40 per pound / 16 ounces per pound = $0.2125 per ounce (approximately)

**3. Calculate the cost of a 4-ounce serving:**

* Cost of 4-ounce serving = $0.2125 per ounce * 4 ounces = $0.85

**Therefore, the answer is (A) $0.85**

300. A whole, bone-in ham weighs 18 lbs as purchased (AP) has an edible portion yield (EP) of 56%. Each ham costs $32.94. What is the invoice cost to serve 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham?
A. $155.55 B. $223.99 C. $277.78 D. $296.46 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: To get the edible portion yield per ham, multiply 18 lbs AP x 56% EP yield =10.08 lbs edible portion per ham. You need 85 lbs cooked sliced ham, so you would divide this amount by the edible portion per ham: 85 lbs ÷ 10.08 lbs = 8.43 hams. Thus, 9 hams are needed. Multiply the cost of the ham $32.94 x 9 hams = $296.46

References: Molt M, Shugart G. Food for Fifty. 13th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson Prentice Hall; 2011::190. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the invoice cost:

**1. Calculate the Edible Product (EP) weight:**

* EP weight = AP weight * EP yield 
* EP weight = 18 lbs * 0.56 = 10.08 lbs per ham

**2. Calculate how many hams you need:**

* Hams needed = Total EP weight needed / EP weight per ham
* Hams needed = 85 lbs / 10.08 lbs/ham = 8.43 hams 
* Since you can't buy parts of hams, round up to 9 hams.

**3. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total cost = Number of hams * Cost per ham
* Total cost = 9 hams * $32.94/ham = $296.46

**Therefore, the answer is D. $296.46**

302. A foodservice establishment requires thirteen 8-hour positions, four 4-hour positions, and one 3-hour position to meet daily demands. How many FTEs per day does the foodservice establishment maintain?
A. 13.26 B. 14.55 C. 15.38 D. 16.72 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 13 × 8 hours = 104 hours; 4 × 4 hours = 16 hours; and one 3 hour = 104 + 16 + 3 = 123 hours total ÷ 8 hours per day = 15.38 FTEs.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the FTEs (Full-Time Equivalent):

**1. Calculate total hours for 8-hour positions:**

* 13 positions * 8 hours/position = 104 hours

**2. Calculate total hours for 4-hour positions:**

* 4 positions * 4 hours/position = 16 hours

**3. Calculate total daily hours:**

* 104 hours + 16 hours + 3 hours = 123 hours

**4. Divide total daily hours by the length of a full-time workday (typically 8 hours):**

* 123 hours / 8 hours/FTE = 15.38 FTEs

**Therefore, the answer is C. 15.38**

303. Which of the following is an example of conceptual decision-making style?
A. The manager solicits suggestions from the team about meal options to eventually promote B. The manager evaluates past experiences to determine meal options that would be successfully promoted C. The manager reviews past sales data to identify which meal options are ideal for promotions D. The manager convenes a committee that will decide by consensus which meal options to promote 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Four common decision-making styles are conceptual (leader seeks ideas from team members), directive (leader uses past experience to arrive at a decision without outside input), analytical (leader uses facts, data, and observation to make a decision), and behavioral (leader collaborates with others, whose feelings and opinions are given equal weight). Conceptual decision-making is effective in long-term projects.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management Principles and Practice. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice Hall; 2012. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best example of a **conceptual decision-making style** is **A. The manager solicits suggestions from the team about meal options to eventually promote.**

Here's why:

* **Conceptual decision-making** is characterized by a broad, future-oriented approach. It involves considering many options, seeking creative solutions, and focusing on long-term goals. 

Let's analyze each option:

* **A:** Soliciting suggestions from the team embodies a conceptual approach. It values diverse perspectives, encourages brainstorming, and aims for a creative solution that considers everyone's input.
* **B:** Evaluating past experiences is more aligned with an **analytical** or **directive** decision-making style, relying on data and past trends.
* **C:** Reviewing past sales data is a data-driven approach, typical of an **analytical** decision-making style.
* **D:** Convening a committee for consensus leans towards a **behavioral** decision-making style, prioritizing collaboration and group harmony.

**In summary:** Option A best reflects the core elements of conceptual decision-making by emphasizing creativity, brainstorming, and a future-oriented perspective.

305. Of the following, which is the type of skill that must develop within and be nurtured in both the personal and professional life of a manager?
A. Hard B. Soft C. Networking D. Communication 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Hard skills can be taught. Soft skills must develop and be nurtured within personal and professional lives.

References: Gould RA, Canter DD. Management matters. J Am Diet Assoc. 2008;108(11)::1834-1836. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **D. Communication**. Here's why:

* **Communication underpins everything:** Effective communication is fundamental to both personal and professional success. It's essential for building relationships, resolving conflicts, conveying ideas, providing feedback, and leading teams. 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A. Hard Skills:** These are technical, job-specific skills. While important, they don't necessarily translate to personal life development in the same way communication does.
* **B. Soft Skills:** This is a broader category that includes communication. While important, it's not as specific and essential as communication itself.
* **C. Networking:**  Networking is valuable, but it's a subset of communication and relationship building.

**In conclusion:** While all the options have their place, communication is the most fundamental skill that needs continuous development in both personal and professional spheres for a manager.

311. What entity conducts hospital accreditation surveys annually?
A. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services B. The Joint Commission  C. DNV D. US Department of Health and Human Services 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: DNV conducts hospital accreditation surveys annually, though they are only reported to CMN every 3 years. The Joint Commission conducts accreditation surveys every 3 years. CMS and HHS do not perform accreditation surveys.

References: DNV. NIAHO Hospital Accreditation. Accessed January 11, 2022. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **B. The Joint Commission**. Here's why:

* **The Joint Commission** is an independent, non-profit organization that accredits and certifies healthcare organizations in the United States.  They are the most widely recognized and respected hospital accreditation body, conducting on-site surveys at least every three years (not annually).

Let's look at the other options:

* **A. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS):** CMS regulates hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. While they have Conditions of Participation that hospitals must meet, they don't directly conduct annual accreditation surveys. They may conduct surveys related to specific concerns or complaints.
* **C. DNV:** DNV is another accreditation body for hospitals and healthcare organizations, but they are not the primary entity conducting annual surveys.
* **D. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):** HHS is a broader government department that oversees CMS. They are not directly involved in conducting hospital accreditation surveys. 

**In summary:** While other organizations play a role in regulating and overseeing hospital quality, The Joint Commission is the primary entity known for conducting hospital accreditation surveys.

312. Which of the following terms is related to marketing?
A. Needs of seller B. Future growth C. Planning for today D. Sales volume 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Successful marketing focuses on producing goods that customers want, forecasting future growth, and being profit oriented. On the other hand, selling stresses the needs of the seller, focuses on the product, is sales-volume-oriented, and plans for today.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **D. Sales volume**. Here's why:

* **Sales volume** is a direct measure of marketing effectiveness. Marketing aims to increase awareness, generate leads, and ultimately drive sales. 

Let's look at why the other options are less related to marketing:

* **A. Needs of seller:** While understanding the seller's needs is important for business, marketing focuses primarily on the **needs and wants of the customer**.
* **B. Future growth:**  While marketing contributes to future growth, it's not the only factor.  Future growth also depends on operations, finance, product development, and more.
* **C. Planning for today:** Marketing involves both short-term and long-term strategies. It's not limited to just planning for today.

**In summary:** Sales volume is the most directly related term to marketing because it represents the tangible outcome of successful marketing efforts.

313. What is the Food Code ruling for use of tobacco by foodservice employees?
A. Employees are not permitted to use tobacco on premises B. Employees may use tobacco in designated areas C. Any use of tobacco is grounds for immediate dismissal D. Continued employment is contingent on eventual participation in a smoking cessation program 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: According to the Food Code, employees are permitted to eat, drink, or use any form of tobacco only in designated areas where there will be no potential contamination of exposed food; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; unwrapped single-service and single-use articles; or other items needing protection..

References: US Department of Health and Human Services. FDA Food Code 2017. Accessed April 23, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The most accurate answer to this question is **closest to A. Employees are not permitted to use tobacco on premises.** Here's why:

* **The FDA Food Code's Focus:** The Food Code, created by the FDA, primarily focuses on food safety practices to prevent foodborne illnesses. It doesn't directly regulate employee tobacco use in a comprehensive way like some workplaces might.

* **Interpretation and Local Regulations:** While the Food Code doesn't have a specific rule banning tobacco use outright, it emphasizes preventing contamination.  This means:
    * **Handwashing:** The Food Code has strict handwashing rules after any activity that could contaminate hands, and this would logically include tobacco use.
    * **Bare Hand Contact:**  Many jurisdictions have adopted rules based on the Food Code that restrict or prohibit bare-hand contact with ready-to-eat foods. Tobacco use would necessitate thorough handwashing and potentially glove changes.

* **Best Practices and Common Sense:**  Even without a specific Food Code rule, prohibiting tobacco use on premises (or at least in food preparation areas) is a best practice for food safety and a common policy in food service establishments.

**Important Note:** Local and state health departments often have their own regulations that build upon the FDA Food Code. These regulations may specifically address employee tobacco use in food service. 

**In summary:** While not a direct, explicit rule in the Food Code, the principles of hygiene and preventing contamination strongly discourage tobacco use by food service employees, and many local regulations will have specific restrictions in place.

324. Among the following, which is the most important plan an onsite foodservice manager should have in place for emergency preparedness?
A. Menu plan B. Staffing plan C. Equipment plan D. Inventory plan 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The menu plan is the key for emergency preparedness. Menu plans vary depending on the type of emergency. Staffing, equipment, and inventory plans are important, but they all revolve around the menu planned for an emergency.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2016; 60. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The most important plan for an onsite foodservice manager in terms of emergency preparedness is **B. Staffing plan**. Here's why:

* **Safety First:** In an emergency, the safety of staff and patrons is paramount. A well-defined staffing plan ensures you have:
    * **Clear roles and responsibilities:**  Who is in charge of evacuation? Who communicates with authorities? Who assists patrons with special needs?
    * **Communication protocols:** How will staff be notified of the emergency? How will they communicate with each other and with management?
    * **Trained personnel:**  Are staff trained in basic first aid, CPR, or how to use fire extinguishers?

While the other options are important aspects of foodservice management, they are secondary to ensuring safety during an emergency:

* **Menu plan (A):**  Important for regular operations and can be adapted during emergencies, but not the top priority.
* **Equipment plan (C):**  Relevant for long-term recovery after an event, but not as crucial as immediate safety.
* **Inventory plan (D):**  Useful for managing resources, but less critical than having a plan to protect human life. 

**In conclusion, a robust staffing plan with clear procedures and trained personnel is the most crucial element of emergency preparedness in an onsite foodservice setting.**

348. Which of the following is part of the definition of an RDN who has achieved a competent level of practice according to the standards of professional performance (SOPP)?
A. Completes a dietetic internship B. Attains RDN credential C. Has 3-5 years of practice experience D. Attains specialty certification 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The SOPP describes a competent practitioner as an individual  who has attained the RDN credential and consistently provides safe and reliable services

References: None 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **C. Has 3-5 years of practice experience**. Here's why:

* **Standards of Professional Performance (SOPP):** These standards, set by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), outline the competent level of practice for RDNs across different career stages. 

* **Competent Level of Practice:** This typically refers to an RDN who has transitioned from entry-level and possesses the skills and experience to practice independently and effectively. While specific years of experience can vary, 3-5 years is a common benchmark for achieving this level.

Let's break down why the other options are not the primary defining factor:

* **A. Completes a dietetic internship:** This is a requirement for becoming an RDN, not specifically for achieving a competent level of practice.
* **B. Attains RDN credential:**  Similar to the internship, this is a baseline requirement to practice as an RDN.
* **D. Attains specialty certification:** While specialty certifications demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specific area, they are not mandatory for achieving a competent level of general RDN practice.

**In summary:** While all the options contribute to an RDN's professional development, having 3-5 years of practice experience is most closely aligned with the SOPP's definition of a competent level of practice.

355. A plan that is adjusted during an emergency to reduce the risk of foodborne and waterborne illness demonstrates which principle of emergency management?
A. Preparedness B. Response C. Mitigation D. Recovery 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Mitigation involves reducing the impact of the emergency by changing processes, policies, and responses as needed. Switching to bottled water when a water supply disruption occurs during an emergency is an example of mitigation. 

References: The Joint Commission. Emergency Management. Accessed February 20, 2023. Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017.  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **(B) Response**. Here's why:

* **Preparedness** involves planning and preparing *before* an emergency to handle it effectively. This includes developing plans, training staff, and gathering resources.
* **Response** is the action taken *during* an emergency to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs. Adjusting a food and water safety plan in real-time falls squarely into this category.
* **Mitigation** focuses on taking steps *before* or *after* an emergency to reduce the likelihood or impact of hazards. This could involve strengthening infrastructure or implementing stricter food safety regulations in general.
* **Recovery** is the process of returning to normal or a new normal *after* an emergency. This includes rebuilding, providing aid, and restoring essential services.

**In summary:** Adjusting a plan during an emergency to address immediate food and water safety concerns is a reactive measure taken in response to the unfolding situation.

A. Choose a specific problem or process to improve B. Review data to better understand the current process C. Create a plan D. Implement and monitor the plan 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The "A" component of the FADE model includes collection of data that are analyzed in order to establish baseline understanding of current processes. The process that will be improved is selected during the focus stage, action plans are developed during the development stage, and the plan is implemented during the execution stage.

References: Joint Commission Resources. Cost-Effective Performance Improvement in Hospitals. Oakbrook Terrace, IL:: JCAHO; 2005::95. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. Choose a specific problem or process to improve**.

Here's why:

* **FADE** stands for **Focus, Analyze, Develop, Execute**. 

Let's break down each component:

* **Focus (A):** This initial stage is all about identifying and clearly defining the problem or process you want to improve. It's about narrowing down your scope and setting a clear objective.
* **Analyze (B):**  Once you know what you're focusing on, you analyze the current state. This involves gathering data, reviewing existing processes, and understanding the root causes of any issues.
* **Develop (C):** With a deep understanding of the problem and its causes, you then develop potential solutions and create a detailed plan for implementation.
* **Execute (D):** The final stage is putting your plan into action, monitoring its progress, and making adjustments as needed.

**In summary:** The "A" component of the FADE model is all about pinpointing the specific area you want to improve before diving into analysis and solution development.

A. Determine how changes will be implemented B. Implement the intervention C. Determine the impact of the intervention D. Maintain and continue improvement 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Determination of how changes will be made is part of the P component of PDSA and impact determination is considered a component of S.

References: Joint Commission Resources. Cost-Effective Performance Improvement in Hospitals. Oakbrook Terrace, IL:: JCAHO; 2005::94. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. Determine the impact of the intervention.**

Here's why:

* **PDSA** stands for **Plan-Do-Study-Act**. It's a cyclical model used for continuous improvement.

* **"D" stands for "Study"**.  In this phase, you analyze the data collected after implementing your change (the "Do" phase) to understand its impact. 

Let's break down the other options:

* **A. Determine how changes will be implemented** - This is part of the **"P" (Plan)** phase, where you develop your strategy for implementing the change.
* **B. Implement the intervention** - This is the **"Do"** phase, where you put your plan into action.
* **D. Maintain and continue improvement** - This is part of the **"A" (Act)** phase.  Based on what you learned in the "Study" phase, you either adopt, adapt, or abandon the change. If adopted, you then focus on sustaining the improvement. 

**In summary, the "Study" (D) phase of the PDSA cycle is all about measuring and analyzing the results of your intervention to determine its effectiveness.** 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


378. Which statement best describes the “A” component of the PDSA performance improvement model?
A. Determine how changes will be implemented B. Implement the intervention C. Determine the impact of the intervention D. Maintain and continue improvement

Here's why:

* **PDSA** stands for **Plan-Do-Study-Act**. It's a cyclical model for continuous improvement.

* **"A" (Act)** in the PDSA cycle represents the stage where you decide on the next steps based on the analysis of the implemented change. This includes:
    * **Standardizing** successful changes by incorporating them into standard procedures.
    * **Modifying** the intervention if it needs further refinement.
    * **Rejecting** the intervention if it was unsuccessful.
    * **Planning further cycles** of the PDSA model to address other areas or refine the existing change.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B. Implement the intervention** - This is part of the **"D" (Do)** phase of the PDSA cycle.
* **C. Determine the impact of the intervention** - This is part of the **"S" (Study)** phase of the PDSA cycle.
* **D. Maintain and continue improvement** - While a general goal of PDSA, this doesn't specifically describe the "A" component. It's more about the ongoing nature of the entire cycle. 

**Therefore, determining how changes will be implemented, including standardization, modification, or rejection, best describes the "A" component of the PDSA model.**

379. Which of the following is least likely to be documented?
A. Employee receiving advice on what to communicate to a contractor in an email B. Employee wearing leggings in violation of dress code C. Employee indicating lack of availability for full-time shifts D. Employee spending hours in conversations unrelated to work 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Documentation of employee behavior includes conduct, performance, appearance, and work availability, which are a part of progressive discipline. Advice is often intended as a friendly offering and is not usually documented.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **A. Employee receiving advice on what to communicate to a contractor in an email.** Here's why:

* **Focus on Documented Actions:** Documentation in a workplace typically focuses on observable actions, behaviors, or decisions that have potential implications for the company. 

* **Why the other options are more likely to be documented:**
    * **B. Employee wearing leggings in violation of dress code:** This is a visible violation of company policy and likely to be documented, especially if it results in a verbal or written warning.
    * **C. Employee indicating lack of availability for full-time shifts:** This impacts scheduling and workforce planning, making it important to document for operational reasons.
    * **D. Employee spending hours in conversations unrelated to work:** This speaks to productivity and potential time theft, making it a likely target for documentation, especially if it becomes a pattern.

* **Why option A is less likely:** While the content of emails to contractors might be documented, a casual conversation about what to say is less likely to be formally recorded. It's considered part of regular workflow and communication.

**Important Note:**  Company cultures and documentation practices vary. There might be situations where even casual advice is documented, especially if it relates to sensitive projects or legal matters.

387. What does the O in the FOCUS-PDCA performance improvement model represent?
A. Identify a process to improve B. Develop a team C. Explain the current process D. Recognize sources of variation 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: In the FOCUS-PDCA model for performance improvement, O represents organizing a team.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Code of Ethics for the Nutrition and Dietetics Profession. 2018. Accessed January 11, 2022. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **D. Recognize sources of variation**.

Here's why:

* **FOCUS-PDCA** is a two-part model for performance improvement:

    * **FOCUS** is the problem-solving phase:
        * **F**ind a process to improve
        * **O**rganize a team 
        * **C**larify knowledge (understand the current process)
        * **U**nderstand potential causes of variation
        * **S**elect the process improvement

    * **PDCA** is the implementation phase:
        * **P**lan
        * **D**o
        * **C**heck
        * **A**ct

Let me know if you'd like more detail on any part of the FOCUS-PDCA model!

389. Which of the following best describes the F component of the FADE performance improvement model?
A. Choose a specific problem or process to improve B. Review data to better understand the current process C. Create a plan D. Complete a pilot study 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In the FADE model, F stands for focus; during this step, the process to be improved is identified and defined. Review of data is included in A, or analyze. Action plans are developed in D, or develop, and pilot studies are conducted in E, or execute.

References: Joint Commission Resources. Cost-Effective Performance Improvement in Hospitals. Oakbrook Terrace, IL:: JCAHO; 2005::95. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **D. Complete a pilot study**.

Here's why:

* **FADE** stands for **Focus, Analyze, Develop, Execute**. 

Let's break down each component:

* **Focus (F):** This is where you choose the problem area (similar to option A).
* **Analyze (A):** This involves gathering and reviewing data to understand the current process (similar to option B).
* **Develop (D):**  This is where you create a plan for improvement (similar to option C).
* **Execute (E):** This final stage is where you implement the plan, often starting with a pilot study to test its effectiveness in a controlled environment.

**Therefore, the "F" in FADE does not stand for "Complete a pilot study". It stands for "Focus".**

392. A manager overlooks older adults for fast-paced supervisory roles without evaluating their qualifications based on an assumption that their age prevents them from being effective. What is this manager demonstrating?
A. Discrimination B. Stereotyping C. Inclusion D. Exclusion 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A manager who makes hiring decisions based on a belief about the abilities of a class of people rather than individual characteristics is demonstrating discrimination.

References: Lund A, Latortue KY, Rodriguez J. Dietetic training:: Understanding racial inequity in power and privilege. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2021;121(8)::1437-1440. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The manager is demonstrating **B. Stereotyping**. Here's why:

* **Stereotyping:** This involves holding a generalized belief about a particular group of people. In this case, the manager assumes that all older adults are incapable of handling fast-paced supervisory roles due to their age. This is a prejudiced oversimplification.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **Discrimination (A):** While stereotyping can lead to discrimination, it's important to differentiate the two. Discrimination is the *action* of treating someone unfairly based on a characteristic like age. The scenario describes the manager's thought process (stereotyping), not necessarily discriminatory actions (though they are likely to follow).
* **Inclusion (C):**  Inclusion is about actively ensuring everyone feels welcome, respected, and valued. The manager's behavior is the opposite of inclusive.
* **Exclusion (D):**  Exclusion is the act of leaving someone out. While the manager's stereotyping would likely lead to the exclusion of older adults, the scenario focuses on the underlying prejudice rather than the direct act of exclusion. 

**In summary:** The manager's assumption about older adults reflects a stereotypical belief about their abilities based solely on their age. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


393. Which of the following business process improvement methodologies relies on employees at all levels to play a key role?
A. Lean Six Sigma B. Kaizen C. Agile Management D. Total Quality Management 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Kaizen is a strategy where employees at all levels of a company work together proactively to achieve regular, incremental improvements in the business process.

References: Lean Production. Kaizen. Accessed January 11, 2022. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **D. Total Quality Management (TQM)**. Here's why:

* **Total Quality Management (TQM)** is a management philosophy that emphasizes continuous improvement and customer satisfaction through the involvement of the entire workforce. It stresses that everyone, from top management to frontline employees, has a role in identifying and solving problems to improve quality.

Let's look at the other options:

* **Lean Six Sigma** focuses on eliminating waste and reducing variation in processes. While it encourages employee involvement, it's often driven by specialized teams.
* **Kaizen** is a system of continuous improvement that originated in Japan. While it values employee suggestions, it often focuses on small, incremental changes driven by teams.
* **Agile Management** is an iterative approach to project management and software development. While it emphasizes collaboration, its primary focus is on adapting to changing requirements and delivering value quickly.

**In summary:** While all of these methodologies encourage employee involvement to some degree, Total Quality Management stands out for its core principle of engaging employees at all levels as a fundamental requirement for success.

400. What does the F component of the FOCUS-PDCA performance improvement model represent?
A. Identify a process to improve B. Develop a team C. Explain the current process D. Maintain and continue improvement 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In the FOCUS-PDCA model for performance improvement, F represents finding an area to improve.

References: SAMHSA HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions. FOCUS PCDA. September 2017. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. Identify a process to improve**.

Here's why:

* **FOCUS-PDCA** is a mnemonic for a performance improvement model. Let's break down what each part stands for:

    * **F**OCUS: 
        * **F**ind a process to improve
    * **O**rganize a team
    * **C**larify knowledge
    * **U**nderstand the process variation and capability
    * **S**elect the process improvement

    * **P**DCA:
        * **P**lan
        * **D**o
        * **C**heck
        * **A**ct

As you can see, the **F** in FOCUS specifically refers to **finding or identifying a process that needs improvement**.

404. What is the most important reason to obtain client consent for posting photographs on social media?
A. To ensure copyright claim is established B. To ensure names are presented correctly C. To ensure HIPAA compliance D. To ensure appearance in the photo is approved 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Although the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act does not specifically refer to social media, privacy could be violated if any patient information is posted. It is considered a standard of professionalism to obtain consent before posting any client testimonials or other details including names, images, and health conditions.  

References: Helm J, Jones RM. Practice Paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics:: Social media and the dietetics practitioner:: Opportunities, challenges, and best practices. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2016;116::1825::1835. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The most important reason to obtain client consent for posting photographs on social media is **D. To ensure appearance in the photo is approved**. 

Here's why:

* **Respect for Privacy:**  Individuals have a right to control their own image and how it's used. Posting a photo without consent is a violation of that privacy, even if it seems harmless.
* **Ethical Considerations:**  Businesses and professionals have an ethical obligation to treat clients with respect, and that includes respecting their right to privacy.
* **Legal Ramifications:** In some cases, using someone's image without consent can have legal consequences, especially if the photo is used for commercial purposes.

**While the other options have some relevance, they are not the most important reason:**

* **A. To ensure copyright claim is established:** Copyright protects the photographer's rights to the image, not necessarily the people in it. 
* **B. To ensure names are presented correctly:** While important for accuracy, it's not the primary reason for obtaining consent.
* **C. To ensure HIPAA compliance:** HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) applies specifically to protected health information. While photos in a healthcare setting might fall under HIPAA, it's not the primary reason for general client photo consent. 

**In summary, obtaining client consent for photos is crucial for ethical reasons, respecting privacy, and avoiding potential legal issues.**

408. When preparing a PES statement in situations where there are diagnoses from multiple domains, which diagnosis domain should the dietetics professional prioritize?
A. Intake B. Physical conditions C. Knowledge D. Nutrition-focused physical findings 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When writing a PES statement and there is a choice between diagnoses from different domains, priority should be given to the intake-related nutrition diagnosis, as it is considered the one more specific to the role of the RDN.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. Communicating the Nutrition Diagnosis or Problem Statement:: PES. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at:: Website 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **A. Intake**. Here's why:

* **The PES statement (Problem, Etiology, Signs/Symptoms) is a standardized format used by dietitians to write nutrition diagnoses.**  The **problem (P)** in a PES statement always comes from the Nutrition Diagnosis Terminology (eNCPT) and is categorized into three domains: 
    * **Intake** (NI):  Problems related to the intake of energy, nutrients, fluids, bioactive substances through oral diet or nutrition support.
    * **Clinical** (NC): Problems related to medical or physical conditions.
    * **Behavioral-Environmental** (NB): Problems related to knowledge, beliefs, physical environment, access to food, or food safety.

* **Prioritizing Intake:** The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) emphasizes prioritizing the Intake domain whenever possible. This is because:
    * **Dietitians have the most direct impact on intake-related issues.** We are uniquely qualified to address problems with food and nutrient consumption.
    * **Intake problems often drive or contribute to problems in other domains.** For example, inadequate protein intake (NI) could lead to muscle wasting (NC) or fatigue (NB).

**Example:**

Let's say a patient has heart disease (NC) and is not consuming enough fruits and vegetables (NI). While both are important, the priority for the PES statement would be the intake problem:

* **P:** Inadequate fruit and vegetable intake (NI)
* **E:** related to...
* **S:** as evidenced by...

**In summary:** While a patient may have diagnoses from multiple domains, the dietetics professional should prioritize the Intake domain when writing a PES statement because it represents the area where they can have the most direct and significant impact. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


412. The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Disaster Feeding Program are examples of food distribution programs. Which of the following statements best describes the similarities of the two programs?
A. Both programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and provide commodity foods to local food distribution and service agencies. B. Both programs serve older adults and provide commodity foods to local food distribution and service agencies C. Both programs serve low-income populations and supplemental food supplies are either distributed to individual households or as meals served in congregate dining centers. D. Both programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and food supplies are either distributed to individual households or as meals served in congregate dining centers. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Both of these programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and provide commodity foods that serve meals. The Emergency Food Assistance Program does not distribute to individual households.

References: The American Dietetic Association. The position of the American Dietetic Association:: child and adolescent nutrition assistance programs. J Am Diet Assoc. 2010;110::794-795. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **A. Both programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and provide commodity foods to local food distribution and service agencies.**

Here's why:

* **Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP):**  TEFAP provides supplemental food packages and commodities to low-income Americans of all ages, including children, adults, and seniors. These foods are distributed through local agencies like food banks and pantries.

* **Disaster Feeding Program:** This program provides food assistance to individuals and families affected by disasters, regardless of age. It utilizes a network of local organizations to distribute meals and commodity foods.

**Let's analyze the other options:**

* **B:** While both programs can serve older adults, it's not their exclusive focus.
* **C:**  The Disaster Feeding Program doesn't solely target low-income populations; it assists anyone affected by a disaster.
* **D:**  While accurate for TEFAP, the Disaster Feeding Program primarily focuses on immediate food needs during emergencies, not regular supplemental assistance.

**In summary:** The key similarity between TEFAP and the Disaster Feeding Program is their reliance on commodity foods and local distribution networks to reach a wide range of age groups.

415. Which of the following is an example of a violation of “beneficence” according to the Code of Ethics?
A. Failing to obtain state licensure B. Providing MNT to a dialysis patient despite having no training in renal dietetics C. Submitting a research paper that plagiarizes a textbook D. Sending an all-staff memo to accuse an employee of theft 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Beneficence represents the concept of professionalism. Within this category, the Code of Ethics requires that individuals “demonstrate respect, constructive dialogue, civility and professionalism in all communications, including social media.” Any suspicions of theft in the workplace should be addressed confidentially. In the Code of Ethics, state licensure and respecting intellectual property rights are related to autonomy, and practicing within professional limits is related to non-maleficence. 

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The Code of Ethics for the Nutrition and Dietetics Profession. Accessed January 21, 2022. Available at:: 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best example of a violation of "beneficence" among the options is **B. Providing MNT to a dialysis patient despite having no training in renal dietetics.** Here's why:

* **Beneficence** in the context of professional ethics (especially in healthcare) means acting in the best interest of the client or patient. This includes having the necessary competence to provide safe and effective care.

Let's break down why the other options are less accurate:

* **A. Failing to obtain state licensure:** This is a serious legal and ethical violation, but it speaks more to professional responsibility and potentially non-maleficence (avoiding harm) rather than beneficence directly.
* **C. Submitting a research paper that plagiarizes a textbook:** This is academic dishonesty and a violation of intellectual property rights. While it indirectly impacts the integrity of the profession, it's not a direct violation of beneficence in a client/patient care context.
* **D. Sending an all-staff memo to accuse an employee of theft:** This is unprofessional behavior and potentially libelous. It reflects poorly on workplace conduct but doesn't directly link to the principle of beneficence in a client/patient care setting.

**In summary:** Providing medical nutrition therapy (MNT) without proper training in renal dietetics could directly harm a dialysis patient. This directly contradicts the ethical principle of beneficence, which prioritizes the well-being and safety of those receiving care. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


429. In a foodservice operation, which of the following is the most critical point of control?
A. Menu B. Quality C. Distribution D. Food procurement 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The menu, a list of food items, serves as the primary control of the foodservice operation and is the common core to all functions. The menu controls each subsystem, is a major determinant for the budget, and reflects the “personality” of the foodservice operation. The menu affects the layout of the operation and the equipment needed to produce it.

References: Gregoire, M. Foodservice Organizations, A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston, MA:: Pearson; 2017:: 42. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The most critical point of control in a foodservice operation is **D. Food procurement**. Here's why:

* **Food Safety Starts at the Source:**  The safety and quality of the food you serve depend heavily on the quality of the ingredients you purchase. Contaminated or poorly handled ingredients at the procurement stage can compromise the entire flow of food, no matter how well you manage the other points.

Let's look at why the other options are important but not *the most* critical:

* **A. Menu:** The menu is important for planning, costing, and communicating with customers, but it doesn't directly control food safety in the same way procurement does.
* **B. Quality:**  While quality is essential throughout the process, it's a result of good practices at every stage, with procurement being the foundation.
* **C. Distribution:** Proper distribution is crucial to maintain food safety after preparation, but if the food was compromised at the procurement stage, proper distribution can't fully mitigate the risk.

**In summary:** Food procurement is the most critical point of control because it sets the stage for everything that follows. Ensuring the safety and quality of ingredients from the very beginning is paramount to maintaining a safe and successful foodservice operation.

450. For a food to be labeled “light” or “lite,” how many calories can it contain?
A. At least 25% fewer calories than the regular food B. Less than 5 calories C. One-third fewer calories than the regular food D. No more than 40 calories 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The food labeling law defines “light” or “lite” as 1/3 fewer calories than the regular food.

References: US Food and Drug Administration. Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Volume 2. Subchapter B:: Food for Human Consumption. Revised April 2019. Accessed August 13, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. At least 25% fewer calories than the regular food**.

Here's why:

* **FDA Regulation:** The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates food labeling. For a food to be labeled "light" or "lite," it must contain at least 25% fewer calories than the regular version of that food.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **B. Less than 5 calories:** This is too low a threshold for most foods to be considered "light."
* **C. One-third fewer calories than the regular food:** While a one-third reduction is significant, the FDA standard is 25%.
* **D. No more than 40 calories:** This is arbitrary and not how the FDA defines "light" foods. 

**Important Note:**  While "light" refers to calories, it's essential to read the entire nutrition label. A food labeled "light" might still be high in fat, sugar, or sodium. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


476. What is the protein recommendation in adults with a pressure injury who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition?
A. 1.2 g to 1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day B. 2.1 g to 2.5 g protein/kg body weight/day C. 0.6 g to 0.8 g protein/kg body weight. D. There are no recommendations because protein is not a concern in pressure ulcer 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Protein facilitates tissue repair, and a high-protein diet may facilitate pressure ulcer healing. It is recommended that adults with a pressure injury who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition have a protein intake of 1.2 g to 1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day.

References: Haesler E, ed; European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance. Prevention and Treatment of Pressure Ulcers/Injuries:: Quick Reference Guide. EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA:: 2019. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **B. 2.1 g to 2.5 g protein/kg body weight/day**. Here's why:

* **Protein's Role in Healing:** Protein is crucial for wound healing. It provides the building blocks for new tissue growth, helps repair damaged tissues, and supports immune function. 

* **Increased Needs with Pressure Injuries:** Individuals with pressure injuries (also called pressure ulcers) have significantly increased protein needs due to the body's efforts to heal the wound. 

* **Malnutrition and Risk:** Malnourished individuals or those at risk have even higher protein requirements to address both the wound and their overall nutritional deficiencies.

**Let's look at the other options:**

* **A. 1.2 g to 1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day:** This is the general protein recommendation for healthy adults and is insufficient for wound healing in malnourished or at-risk individuals.
* **C. 0.6 g to 0.8 g protein/kg body weight:** This is far too low and could worsen malnutrition and hinder wound healing.
* **D. There are no recommendations because protein is not a concern in pressure ulcer:** This is incorrect. Protein is a major concern in pressure ulcer management.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to consult with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional for personalized nutrition recommendations for individuals with pressure injuries. They can assess individual needs, consider other medical conditions, and create a tailored plan. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


477. Which of the following is the correct term to describe a storeroom within a university's residence hall foodservice that is staffed with a full-time employee?
A. Input B. Subsystem C. Interface D. Technical core 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A subsystem is a complete system unto itself (such as a storeroom) that is part of a larger system (in this case, a university residence hall foodservice).

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best answer here is **D. Technical core**. Here's why:

* **Technical core** refers to the operational heart of a system where the primary production or service takes place. In a foodservice context, the storeroom with a full-time employee represents a crucial part of the operation (managing inventory, supplies, etc.)

Let's look at why the other options aren't as fitting:

* **Input:**  Inputs are resources that go into a system. While the storeroom houses inputs (food, supplies), it's not the term for the room itself.
* **Subsystem:** A subsystem is a smaller system within a larger one. While the storeroom is part of the larger foodservice system, it's too specific to be considered a major subsystem.
* **Interface:** An interface is a point of interaction between systems or parts of a system. The storeroom doesn't primarily function as a point of interaction.

**In summary:** The storeroom, with its dedicated staff member, is best described as part of the technical core of the residence hall's foodservice operation. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


478. What is the term for when allergens are transferred from food containing an allergen to the food served to the customer?
A. Cross-contact B. Cross-contamination C. Cross-connection D. Cross-transfer 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Cross-contact is related to allergens and cross-contamination is related to pathogens. Cross-contact occurs when food containing an allergen makes contact with a "safe" food. Cross-contamination is when pathogens can be transferred from one surface or food to another. Cross-connection is a physical link between safe water and dirty water, which can come from drains, sewers, or other wastewater sources. Cross-transfer is a made-up term.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **B. Cross-contamination**. Here's why:

* **Cross-contamination** specifically refers to the unintentional transfer of harmful substances, including allergens, from one food or surface to another. This can happen through shared utensils, cutting boards, gloves, or even by splashing during food preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Cross-contact** is a term often used interchangeably with cross-contamination, particularly in food allergy contexts. However, it emphasizes the physical contact between the allergen and the allergen-free food.
* **Cross-connection** usually refers to a plumbing issue where potable (drinkable) water supplies might be contaminated by non-potable water sources.
* **Cross-transfer** is not a commonly used term in food safety and allergy contexts.

**In summary:** While "cross-contact" is sometimes used, "cross-contamination" is the most widely accepted and understood term for allergens being transferred to food served to a customer. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


485. In a PES statement, what is the phrase that links signs and symptoms to etiology?
A. "Because of" B. "Related to" C. "As a result of" D. "As evidenced by" 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The format for each nutrition diagnosis, or PES, statement is problem (P), etiology (E), signs and symptoms (S).

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. Communicating the Nutrition Diagnosis or Problem Statement. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **(B) "Related to"**. Here's why:

* **PES Statement Structure:** A PES statement in nursing diagnosis is structured as follows:
    * **P**roblem: The patient's health issue (using NANDA-I terminology)
    * **E**tiology: The underlying cause or contributing factors
    * **S**ymptoms: Defining characteristics or evidence of the problem

* **"Related to"** is the connecting phrase that establishes a relationship between the identified problem (P) and its suspected cause or etiology (E). It suggests a possible link but doesn't imply direct causation.

**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**

* **"Because of"** implies a direct causal relationship, which may not always be certain in a nursing diagnosis. 
* **"As a result of"** also suggests a direct causal link.
* **"As evidenced by"** connects the problem (P) to the signs and symptoms (S), not the etiology (E).

**Example:**

* **Ineffective Airway Clearance (P) related to (R) thick mucus secretions (E) as evidenced by (AEB) coarse crackles in lungs and difficulty coughing (S).**

507. Which of the following lunch menus reflect proper menu planning principles?
A. Steamed haddock, rice, roasted cauliflower, vanilla frozen yogurt with fresh pineapple B. Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries C. Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet D. Meatballs, tiny whole potatoes, Brussels sprouts, fresh bing cherries 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The meal in choice B (baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries) shows the best use of color in a lunch meal, as well as a variety of flavors, textures, consistency, and food shapes that are balanced. The foods complement each other and employ a variety of cooking methods. The meals in answer choices A and C are mostly white in color and not as visually appealing. The meal in option D has color variety, but all the foods have the same shape (round).

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's a breakdown of why the best answer is **C. Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet**, and how it reflects proper menu planning principles:

**C. Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet**

* **Variety and Balance:**
    * **Protein:** Grilled chicken breast (lean protein)
    * **Starch:** Mashed potatoes 
    * **Vegetable:** Steamed parsnips (offers a different flavor and texture than potatoes)
    * **Dessert:** Lemon sorbet (light and refreshing, balances the heavier meal)
* **Flavor and Texture:** Offers a good mix of flavors (savory chicken, slightly sweet parsnips, tart sorbet) and textures (creamy mashed potatoes, firm chicken, smooth sorbet).
* **Color:**  A visually appealing plate with the potential for white (chicken, potatoes), orange (parsnips), and pale yellow (sorbet).

**Why the other options are not as strong:**

* **A. Steamed haddock, rice, roasted cauliflower, vanilla frozen yogurt with fresh pineapple:**  Heavy on white/beige colors, potentially bland flavor profile.
* **B. Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries:**  Two potentially dry items (pork chop, rice pilaf) without a strong contrasting element.
* **D. Meatballs, tiny whole potatoes, Brussels sprouts, fresh bing cherries:** While this menu has good variety, it lacks a cohesive flavor profile. The sweetness of the cherries clashes with the savory meatballs and potentially bitter Brussels sprouts.

**Key Menu Planning Principles:**

* **Variety:** Different food groups, flavors, textures, and colors.
* **Balance:**  Nutrient-rich choices, appropriate portion sizes.
* **Flavor:** Complementary and contrasting flavors that work well together.
* **Texture:** A mix of textures to keep the meal interesting.
* **Appearance:** Visually appealing with a variety of colors.
* **Consideration for the audience:** Age, dietary needs, preferences.

515. A hospital foodservice uses the FIFO inventory method.  On May 1, the hospital purchased 3 cans of pears at $6.66 each.  On May 15, they purchased 6 cans of pears at $6.72 each.  On May 31, they purchased 9 cans of pears at $6.78 each. When inventory was checked on June 1, it was determined that 12 cans of pears had been used. What is the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the 12 cans of pears?
A. $121.32 B. $79.92 C. $81.18 D. $80.64 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The first in, first out (FIFO) method assumes the first products a company has acquired are also the first products that it sells. Thus, using the FIFO method in this scenario, the cost of the older cans is used first. 

References: Investopedia. How to calculate the cost of goods sold using the FIFO method. Updated September 2019. Accessed December 15, 2020. Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) using the FIFO method:

**FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**

This method assumes that the first items purchased are the first items sold.

1. **May 1 Purchase:** 3 cans x $6.66 = $19.98
2. **May 15 Purchase:** 6 cans x $6.72 = $40.32
3. **May 31 Purchase:**  We only need 3 cans from this purchase (12 total cans used - 3 from May 1 - 6 from May 15 = 3). 3 cans x $6.78 = $20.34

**Total COGS:** $19.98 + $40.32 + $20.34 = **$80.64**

**Therefore, the answer is D. $80.64**

516. Which of the following represents a legal basis for dismissal, depending on company policy?
A. Using Instagram and Twitter while at the workplace B. Complaining about the workplace dress code with coworkers while on office property C. Posting comments on a site that publishes employer reviews D. Creating a private group for colleagues to complain about a company's benefits package 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Although use of social media at the workplace is not in itself illegal, employers have the legal right to bar its use during work hours. However, posting comments on company review sites and airing grievances to other coworkers, so long as the complaints are related to employment terms and conditions, are forms of protected speech and employers do not have the legal right to terminate an employee for these behaviors.

References: Bell JD. Firing for online behavior. Society for Human Resource Management magazine. August 24, 2018. Accessed May 13, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **all of the above**, depending on company policy. Here's why:

* **A. Using Instagram and Twitter while at the workplace:**  Most companies have policies regarding internet and social media usage during work hours. Excessive personal use can be grounds for dismissal.
* **B. Complaining about the workplace dress code with coworkers while on office property:** While seemingly harmless, this could be construed as disruptive or creating a negative work environment, especially if the conversation becomes heated or disrespectful. 
* **C. Posting comments on a site that publishes employer reviews:** Employees have some protection under the law to discuss working conditions, but posting negative comments, especially if they are false or defamatory, can have consequences. Companies may have policies against disclosing confidential information or making disparaging remarks publicly.
* **D. Creating a private group for colleagues to complain about a company's benefits package:**  Similar to C, while employees can discuss working conditions, creating a dedicated platform for complaints could be seen as organizing dissent and may violate company policies, especially if it disrupts work or harms the company's reputation.

**Important Note:**  The key phrase here is "depending on company policy."  Companies have the right to establish policies regarding employee conduct, and what might be acceptable in one workplace could be grounds for dismissal in another. It's crucial for employees to be aware of their company's specific policies.

528. Why is it critical to use a valid and reliable malnutrition screening tool?
A. To limit unnecessary nutrition referrals B. So that any health care professional can complete the screening C. To diagnose nutrition-related health conditions D. So that there is consistency in who is screened  

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A malnutrition screening tool that is valid and reliable increases the likelihood of positively identifying possible malnutrition, thereby reducing referrals for individuals who do not have malnutrition. Screening is intended to identify risk and not evaluate and diagnose; as such, screening takes place before the Nutrition Care Process.

References: Skipper A, Coltman A, Tomesko J, et al. Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics:: Malnutrition (Undernutrition) Screening Tools for All Adults. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2019;120(4). Available at:: Website  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The most accurate answer here is **A. To limit unnecessary nutrition referrals.** Here's why:

* **Valid and reliable tools increase accuracy:**  Valid tools measure what they are supposed to (malnutrition risk), and reliable tools produce consistent results. This accuracy is key to identifying individuals who truly need nutritional intervention.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B. So that any health care professional can complete the screening:** While simplicity is a benefit, the primary goal of a screening tool is accuracy, not just ease of use.
* **C. To diagnose nutrition-related health conditions:** Screening tools assess *risk*, they don't diagnose. A diagnosis requires a more comprehensive assessment by a qualified professional.
* **D. So that there is consistency in who is screened:** Consistency is important, but the primary reason for using a valid and reliable tool is to ensure the *accuracy* of the screening process, leading to appropriate referrals.

**In summary:** The critical reason for using a valid and reliable malnutrition screening tool is to make sure that resources are directed to those who truly need them, avoiding unnecessary referrals and potential delays in care.

540. What type of flooring may be recommended for a food preparation area?
A. Wood B. Ceramic tile C. Carpet D. Linoleum 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Linoleum may be recommended for food preparation areas because it is resilient, nonabsorbent, and easily cleaned. Wood, ceramic tile, and carpeting are not appropriate for food preparation areas. 

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017:: 82. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best answer out of these options is **D. Linoleum**. Here's why:

* **Linoleum** is a durable, non-porous, and water-resistant material. It's relatively easy to clean and sanitize, making it a good choice for food preparation areas.

Here's why the other options aren't as suitable:

* **A. Wood:** Wood is porous, meaning it can absorb liquids and harbor bacteria. It's also susceptible to damage from moisture and heat.
* **B. Ceramic tile:** While ceramic tile itself is fairly easy to clean, the grout lines can be difficult to keep clean and sanitary. 
* **C. Carpet:** Carpet is completely unsuitable for food preparation areas. It's very difficult to clean and sanitize, and it can harbor bacteria and allergens.

**Important Note:** While linoleum is a good option, other flooring materials specifically designed for commercial kitchens, like quarry tile or poured epoxy, are often preferred for their superior durability and ease of cleaning.

548. Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) increases when which of the following conditions is present?
A. Malnutrition B. Nephritis C. Hepatitis D. Hemolytic anemia 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: TIBC increases in individuals with hepatitis. TIBC decreases in individuals with malnutrition, nephritis, and hemolytic anemia. 

References: Raymond JL, McMorrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 66. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **D. Hemolytic anemia**. Here's why:

* **Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC):** TIBC measures the maximum amount of iron your blood can carry. It reflects the levels of transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood.

* **Hemolytic Anemia:** This condition involves the destruction of red blood cells at a faster rate than the bone marrow can produce them.  Since red blood cells carry iron, their destruction releases iron into the bloodstream. This excess iron isn't immediately used up, leading to an increase in transferrin production (to transport the extra iron) and a subsequent rise in TIBC.

**Here's why the other options are incorrect:**

* **A. Malnutrition:** Malnutrition, especially iron deficiency, would actually *decrease* TIBC.  The body tries to maximize iron absorption and transport when iron levels are low, leading to *increased* transferrin production and TIBC.
* **B. Nephritis (Kidney Inflammation):** Nephritis can lead to decreased production of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production. This can result in anemia, but it's usually not associated with a significant increase in TIBC.
* **C. Hepatitis (Liver Inflammation):**  Hepatitis can affect iron metabolism, but it's more likely to cause a *decrease* in TIBC. This is because the liver produces transferrin, and liver damage can impair its production.

**In summary:** Hemolytic anemia is the most likely condition to cause an increase in TIBC due to the release of iron from destroyed red blood cells.

560. A group of registered dietitian nutritionists meets with legislators to educate them on an important nutrition issue. This activity is known as
A. advocacy. B. lobbying. C. sponsorship. D. petitioning. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Advocacy is when an individual or group educates legislators or other government officials and advocates for change on issues they are passionate about. Lobbyists are professionals who are paid to visit Congress and advocate for specific issues. Sponsorship is when a legislator endorses and introduces a bill. In petitioning, a group signs a written request asking for a legislator to pass a bill.

References: Edelstein S. Nutrition in public health:: a handbook for developing programs and services. 3rd ed. Sudbury, MA:: Jones & Bartlett; 2010. Ebrahimkhel T. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Grassroots Advocacy 101. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2018;118(8)::1501-1505. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. advocacy**. Here's why:

* **Advocacy** is the act of publicly supporting or recommending a particular cause or policy. In this case, the dietitians are advocating for better nutrition policies by educating legislators.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **Lobbying** involves direct attempts to influence legislation through communication with legislators or their staff. While advocacy can be a part of lobbying, it's a broader term. The scenario doesn't specify if the dietitians are directly urging for a specific bill or action.
* **Sponsorship** usually refers to financial or material support for an event or activity. This doesn't fit the scenario.
* **Petitioning** involves gathering signatures to demonstrate public support for a cause, which is not described in the scenario. 

**In summary:**  The dietitians are engaging in advocacy by using their expertise to raise awareness and educate lawmakers on an important nutrition issue.

594. The indicator head of a bimetallic stemmed thermometer ranges from 0˚F to
A. 180 F B. 200 F C. 220 F D. 250 F 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: The indicator must be able to register temperatures below 32˚F to accommodate incoming frozen food shipments and above 212˚F to accommodate hot holdings. The bimetallic stemmed thermometer ranges from 0˚F to 220˚F.

References: National Restaurant Association Education Foundation. ServSafe Coursebook. 6th ed. Chicago:: NRA; 2012::5-4. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

There's no single, universally correct answer to this question. Here's why:

* **Bimetallic thermometers are designed for various purposes:** Some measure low temperatures (like ovens), while others handle much higher ranges (industrial applications). 
* **The question lacks context:** It doesn't specify what the thermometer is intended to measure.

**However:**

* **Common household oven thermometers:** These often have a range that goes up to around **500°F (260°C)**.
* **Other common ranges:** You might find bimetallic thermometers with maximum temperatures of **220°F (104°C)** or **250°F (121°C)** for applications like candy making or deep frying.

**In conclusion:**  Without more information about the specific thermometer, it's impossible to give a definitive answer.

642. Which survey tracks prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and has been used to develop nutrition policy?
A. NHANES B. FLAPS C. Healthy People 2020 D. BRFSS 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) is the national survey that collects data that are measured at mobile examination centers and is the most comprehensive survey used that informs health policy.

References: Boyle MA.  Community Nutrition in Action. 7th ed. Cengage; 2017. National Center for Health Statistics. About the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Accessed January 10, 2022. Available at:: Website 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. NHANES**. Here's why:

* **NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey):** This large-scale survey directly collects data on the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. It includes physical examinations, laboratory tests, and dietary interviews, making it ideal for tracking chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Data from NHANES is used extensively to develop nutrition policy, such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **FLAPS (Food Label and Package Survey):** This survey focuses on information presented on food labels and packaging, not the prevalence of diseases.
* **Healthy People 2020:** This is a set of national health objectives, not a survey. While it addresses chronic diseases, it doesn't directly track their prevalence.
* **BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System):** This survey collects data on health behaviors and risk factors through telephone interviews. While it might gather some information on chronic disease diagnoses, it doesn't include the physical examinations and lab tests needed for accurate prevalence tracking like NHANES does. 

**In summary, NHANES is the most comprehensive survey for tracking chronic disease prevalence and directly informs nutrition policy decisions.**

643. Which of these reflects proper storage practice
A. Raw meat placed above fresh broccoli B. Raw whole cuts of beef placed above raw fish C. Raw poultry placed above raw whole cuts of beef D. Raw fish placed above raw poultry 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The order of placement in the refrigerator is based on the minimum internal cooking temperature of each food. 

References: National Restaurant Association Education Foundation. ServSafe Coursebook. 6th ed. Chicago:: NRA; 2012::7-5. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

None of the options reflect proper storage practice. Here's why:

**Proper storage order in a refrigerator is crucial to prevent cross-contamination:**

* **Top Shelf (Coldest):** Ready-to-eat foods (leftovers, yogurt, cheese)
* **Middle Shelves:**  Raw whole cuts of beef and pork (on a plate or in a container to catch drips)
* **Below Beef/Pork:** Raw ground meat and fish (again, on a plate or in a container)
* **Bottom Shelf (Coldest Part):** Raw poultry (this is because poultry tends to drip more)
* **Drawers:** Fruits, vegetables, and herbs

**Why this order?**

Raw meat, poultry, and fish can contain harmful bacteria. If they drip onto foods stored below them, those foods can become contaminated. 

**The safest practice is to always store raw meats, poultry, and fish on the lowest shelves of your refrigerator, ensuring they are well-sealed to prevent any drips.** 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


644. Which of the following oils is best suited for frying?
A. Olive B. Flax C. Coconut D. Grapeseed 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Grapeseed oil has a higher smoke point that is ideal for frying. Coconut oil is ideal for sautéing and baking, flax oil is ideal for use in smoothies and salad dressings, and olive oil is ideal for sautéing.

References: Edelstein S. Food Science:: An Ecological Approach. 2nd ed. Jones & Bartlett Learning; 2019:: 527. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best oil for frying out of those listed is **D. Grapeseed**. Here's why:

* **High Smoke Point:** Grapeseed oil has a high smoke point (the temperature at which an oil starts to break down and smoke), around 420°F (215°C). Frying requires oil that can withstand high heat without breaking down and imparting off-flavors.

Here's why the other options aren't as suitable:

* **Olive Oil:** While healthy, most olive oils have a lower smoke point (around 375°F/190°C), making them better for sautéing or lower-heat cooking. Extra virgin olive oil has an even lower smoke point.
* **Flax Oil:** Flaxseed oil is very delicate and has a very low smoke point, making it unsuitable for frying. It's best used cold in dressings or as a finishing oil.
* **Coconut Oil:** Coconut oil has a high smoke point (around 350°F/175°C), but it has a distinct coconut flavor that can be overpowering in some dishes. 

**Other good oils for frying:**

* **Avocado Oil:**  Neutral flavor and a very high smoke point (around 520°F/270°C).
* **Peanut Oil:**  Neutral flavor and a high smoke point (around 450°F/232°C). 

**Important Note:** Always choose refined oils for frying as they have higher smoke points compared to their unrefined counterparts. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


661. Which part of the foodservice systems model encompasses human labor and skill?
A. Input B. Output C. Control D. Transformation 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The primary components of the foodservice system model include input, transformation, and output. Additional components in the foodservice system model include control, memory, environmental factors, and feedback. Input categories include human, materials, facilities, and operational. Human labor and skills are required to meet the objectives of the system.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **D. Transformation**. Here's why:

* **Transformation** is the heart of the foodservice systems model. It's where all the resources (inputs) are combined and processed to create the final meal (output).  Human labor and skill are essential elements within the transformation process. This includes:
    * **Cooking:**  Chefs, cooks, and line cooks use their skills to prepare and cook the food.
    * **Assembly:**  Staff assemble meals, plate dishes, and portion food.
    * **Serving:** Servers, bartenders, and cashiers interact with customers and deliver the final product.
    * **Management:** Managers oversee operations, ensuring efficiency and quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Input:**  Inputs are the resources that go *into* the system, such as ingredients, equipment, and even money. 
* **Output:** Outputs are the *results* of the system, primarily the meals served to customers, but also things like customer satisfaction and profit.
* **Control:** Control mechanisms ensure the system is functioning correctly and meeting its goals. This includes things like recipes, sanitation procedures, and budget management.

**In summary:** Human labor and skill are the driving force behind the **transformation** of raw ingredients and resources into prepared meals in a foodservice system.

705. When is it OK to store raw poultry immersed in ice? (Assume all other conditions for safe storage have been met.)
A. If it will be used by the end of the day B. If it will be used by the end of the week C. If it was received that way D. Never 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: If raw poultry or raw fish is received immersed in ice in shipping containers, they may be stored in that condition until preparation, display, service, or sale.

References: US Public Health Service. Food Code 2017. Accessed June 25, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **D. Never**.

Here's why:

* **Safety Risk:** Immersing raw poultry in ice creates an environment where bacteria can thrive. The melting ice can introduce contaminants into the poultry, and the cold temperature alone isn't enough to prevent bacterial growth.
* **Quality Degradation:** Soaking poultry in water, even ice water, can make it waterlogged and negatively impact its texture and flavor.

**Proper Storage of Raw Poultry:**

* **Refrigerator:** Store raw poultry in the coldest part of the refrigerator (usually the bottom shelf) at a temperature of 40°F (4°C) or below. 
* **Freezing:** For longer storage, freeze raw poultry at 0°F (-18°C) or below. 

**Important Note:** If you received raw poultry immersed in ice, it's best to contact the supplier or store where you purchased it to inquire about their handling practices.

708. Which vitamin deficiency is likely to develop in a patient with liver disease?
A. A B. E C. D D. K 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Vitamin D deficiency is frequently reported in liver disease patients and is thought to result from impaired synthesis and absorption.

References: Barchetta I, Angelico F, Del Ben M, et al. Strong association between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and low 25(OH) vitamin D levels in an adult population with normal serum liver enzymes. BMC Med. 2011;9(1)::85. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **D. K**

Here's why:

* **Vitamin K** is essential for blood clotting. The liver plays a crucial role in producing the proteins that help with blood clotting, and these proteins rely on vitamin K to function correctly. 
* **Liver disease** can impair the liver's ability to use vitamin K effectively, leading to a deficiency. This deficiency increases the risk of excessive bleeding.

**While deficiencies in other vitamins can occur with liver disease, vitamin K deficiency is a primary concern.**

715. Which of the following is an expected outcome from obtaining a National Provider Identification (NPI) number?
A. To prevent other less-qualified nutritionists from obtaining one B. To share with prospective clients for an outpatient nutrition counseling center C. To obtain a certificate to display nutrition expertise D. To demonstrate adequate workforce capacity for Medicare payment policies 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The NPI serves as a "digital footprint" that can enable better understanding of the care provided, including specific nutrition interventions, RDN attribution to patient care, and the evaluation and reporting of outcomes and quality measures. The individual NPI is an important mechanism for demonstrating a viable workforce of RDN and NDTRs to external stakeholders, including public and private payors. All credentialed nutrition and dietetics practitioners (RDNs and NDTRs) should have an individual NPI regardless of work environment, employment status, or whether claims are submitted to payers

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Obtaining an NPI or EIN. Accessed August 23, 2021. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **B. To share with prospective clients for an outpatient nutrition counseling center**. Here's why:

* **What an NPI is:** The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique 10-digit identification number required for all healthcare providers in the United States. It's used for administrative and financial transactions, like billing insurance companies.

* **Why it's important for client interaction:**  When a client seeks reimbursement for nutrition counseling from their insurance company, the provider will need to include their NPI on the claim form. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A. To prevent other less-qualified nutritionists from obtaining one:** The NPI is not designed to limit the number of practitioners in a field. Its purpose is identification and administrative efficiency.
* **C. To obtain a certificate to display nutrition expertise:**  An NPI is a number, not a certificate.  Certification in nutrition comes from organizations like the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) and is separate from the NPI.
* **D. To demonstrate adequate workforce capacity for Medicare payment policies:** While NPIs are part of the healthcare system, they don't directly demonstrate workforce capacity.

**In summary:** The NPI is a crucial identifier for healthcare providers, including nutritionists, to interact with insurance companies and facilitate client reimbursement.

716. Which of the following has a potential causal relationship with cognitive decline and dementia?
A. B12 deficiency B. Excessive vitamin D intake C. Insulin resistance D. Soy allergy 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: B12 deficiency is associated with dementia. 

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elseiver; 2021:: 888. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **A. B12 deficiency, C. Insulin resistance** 

Here's why:

* **B12 Deficiency:** Vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function and cell health in the brain. A deficiency can lead to cognitive problems like memory loss, confusion, and difficulty concentrating, all of which can mimic dementia symptoms. 

* **Insulin Resistance:**  Insulin resistance, often associated with Type 2 diabetes, is increasingly linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline.  The exact mechanisms are complex but may involve inflammation, blood vessel damage in the brain, and impaired glucose metabolism in brain cells.

Let's look at the other options:

* **Excessive Vitamin D Intake:** While vitamin D is important for overall health, excessive intake is not directly linked to cognitive decline or dementia. In fact, some studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency might be a risk factor, but more research is needed.

* **Soy Allergy:**  A soy allergy is an immune response to soy protein and is not directly associated with cognitive decline or dementia.

**Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice. If you have concerns about cognitive health, please consult a healthcare professional.

A. 10 B. 11 C. 12 D. 13 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: 1200/3.99= 300.75 entrees, 300.75 entrees/24 servings= 12.5, Round up to make 13 batches of the recipe to have enough entrees to sell to meet the sales goal.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the revenue per recipe batch:**

* One recipe batch makes 24 servings.
* Each serving sells for $3.99.
* Revenue per batch: 24 servings * $3.99/serving = $95.76

**2. Determine the number of batches needed:**

* Sales goal: $1200
* Revenue per batch: $95.76
* Number of batches: $1200 / $95.76/batch ≈ 12.53

**3. Round up to the nearest whole number:**

* You can't make a fraction of a batch, so round up to ensure you meet the sales goal.

**Answer:** You should prepare **13 batches** (option D) to meet the sales goal.

718. Which of the following is a safe temperature for TCS foods?
A. 65 F B. 130 F C. 41 F D. 100 F 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: TCS refers to time/temperature control for safety. TCS foods are safe at 41°F or below and 135°F and above.

References: Reference:: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017:: 236. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The safe temperature for TCS foods is **C. 41 F** or below. Here's why:

* **TCS Foods:** TCS stands for Time/Temperature Control for Safety. These foods are more susceptible to bacteria growth and need to be kept at specific temperatures.

* **Danger Zone:** The temperature range between 41°F and 135°F (5°C and 57°C) is known as the "danger zone."  Bacteria multiply rapidly within this range.

* **Keeping Food Safe:** To prevent foodborne illness, TCS foods should be kept out of the danger zone. This means storing them at 41°F or below (refrigeration) or holding them at 135°F or above (hot holding). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


723. Which of following are defined by standards of identity?
A. How full a food product container must be B. What ingredients must be declared on a label C. Minimum specifications for quality requirements D. Serving size and nutrient analysis 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The Standards of Identity define what a given food product is, its name, and the ingredients which must or may be used, and which ones must be declared on the label. 

References: Science Direct. Standards of Identity. Accessed September 10, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **C. Minimum specifications for quality requirements**. Here's why:

* **Standards of Identity** are regulations that define what a food product *is*. They set minimum requirements for the type and amount of ingredients a food must contain to be labeled and sold as a specific name (e.g., "mayonnaise," "ice cream," "bread"). 

Let's look at the other options:

* **A. How full a food product container must be:** This is regulated by "fill of container" standards, not standards of identity. These standards prevent deceptive packaging.
* **B. What ingredients must be declared on a label:** This is governed by broader food labeling regulations, ensuring transparency for consumers about what's in their food.
* **D. Serving size and nutrient analysis:** These are also part of general food labeling regulations, specifically the Nutrition Facts panel.

**In summary:** Standards of identity focus on the core composition of a food product to ensure it meets a recognized standard.

734. Which of the following is the BEST example of an educational objective?
A. Participant will understand components of a Mediterranean eating pattern B. Given a list of foods, participant will identify those highest in MUFA C. Participant will verbalize components of a Mediterranean eating plan D. Instructor will provide a list of foods high in MUFA 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Educational objectives specify the means to achieve an outcome, whereas educational goals do not specify how an outcome will be reached. Because options A and C do not specify the means to achieve an outcome, they are educational goals. Furthermore, educational objectives focus on what participants will learn, not what an instructor will do, so option D is not correct. That the student will learn something specific (foods high in MUFA) and how (by being given a list of foods),

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best example of an educational objective from your list is **C. Participant will verbalize components of a Mediterranean eating plan.** Here's why:

* **Focus on the Learner:** Educational objectives should center on what the learner will be able to do after the instruction. Option C clearly identifies the participant as the one performing the action (verbalizing).

* **Measurable and Specific:**  "Verbalize" is a measurable action. You can observe and assess whether a participant can verbally list or describe the components. Option A ("understand") is vague and difficult to measure.

* **Action-Oriented:**  The verb "verbalize" indicates an observable action the participant will take, demonstrating their knowledge.

**Let's look at the other options:**

* **A. Participant will understand components of a Mediterranean eating pattern:**  "Understand" is not easily measurable. How do you objectively determine if someone "understands"?
* **B. Given a list of foods, participant will identify those highest in MUFA:** This is a good objective, but it's more specific and task-oriented. Option C is broader, encompassing a more general understanding of the eating plan.
* **D. Instructor will provide a list of foods high in MUFA:** This describes the instructor's action, not the learner's outcome.

**In summary:** A strong educational objective focuses on the learner's observable actions and demonstrates a clear, measurable outcome.

735. A foodservice has a 35% labor cost, 23% fixed costs, and a desired profit of 12%. Given a raw food cost of $4.55, what would be the selling price of an item when rounded up to $0.99 on the dollar?
A. $13.99 B. $14.99 C. $15.99 D. $16.99 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: First determine the divisor: Divisor – (labor cost + fixed costs + desired profit). In this case 100% – (35% + 23% +12%) = 100% – 70% = 30%. To calculate sales price: Cost/Divisor = $4.55/0.3 = $15.16. Round up to $15.99.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the selling price:

**1. Calculate the target cost percentage:**

* Total desired cost percentage = Labor Cost + Fixed Costs + Desired Profit
* Total desired cost percentage = 35% + 23% + 12% = 70%

**2. Calculate the allowable food cost percentage:**

* Allowable food cost percentage = 100% - Total desired cost percentage
* Allowable food cost percentage = 100% - 70% = 30%

**3. Calculate the selling price based on the allowable food cost percentage:**

* Selling price = Raw Food Cost / Allowable Food Cost Percentage
* Selling price = $4.55 / 0.30 = $15.17

**4. Round up to the nearest $0.99:**

* Since $15.17 is closest to $15.99 when rounding up to the nearest $0.99, the final selling price is **$15.99**.

**Therefore, the answer is C. $15.99**

737. Which of the following saucepans would conduct heat most effectively?
A. 4 gauge B. 10 gauge C. 14 gauge D. 20 gauge 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The higher the gauge of a saucepan, the thinner the metal. Heavier stainless steel does not conduct heat well. Therefore, the best option in this case is a 20-gauge saucepan.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Prentice Hall; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to determine the answer:

* **Gauge and Thickness:**  Lower gauge numbers indicate thicker metal. For example, 4 gauge is much thicker than 20 gauge.
* **Heat Conduction:** Thicker metals conduct heat more effectively and evenly.

**Therefore, the answer is A. 4 gauge.** 

A 4 gauge saucepan will have the thickest metal and thus conduct heat the best.

778. What is the recommended way to serve fruit on the IDDSI Level 5 diet?
A. Mashed B. Cubed C. Sliced D. Julienned 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative, fruits served on Level 5 Orange Minced & Moist should be served mashed with excess thin juice drained and skin and pips removed.

References: International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative. IDDSI Framework. Accessed March 4, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **C. Sliced**. Here's why:

* **IDDSI Level 5 (Minced & Moist)** foods need to be soft and easy to chew.  While mashed fruit is technically Level 5, it's not the most appealing presentation. 
* **Sliced fruit** offers a good balance:
    * **Easy to manage:**  The slices should be thin enough to be easily chewed and swallowed.
    * **Visually appealing:** Sliced fruit looks more appetizing than mashed fruit.
* **Cubed fruit** can be appropriate depending on the size of the cubes and the individual's chewing abilities. However, it presents a slightly higher choking risk than thin slices.
* **Julienned fruit** is cut into thin strips, which could be a choking hazard for someone on a Level 5 diet.

**Important Note:** Always consider the individual's specific needs and abilities when preparing food, even within an IDDSI level.

790. Which of the following actions would likely be the result of systems thinking?
A. Select a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily. B. Reschedule kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations. C. Develop a catering menu for department meetings to generate revenue for equipment purchases. D. Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Systems thinking is the management approach to considering the entire organization when making decisions or allocating resources. Rescheduling kitchen staff to prepare food to meet customer expectations changes the kitchen and staff/resource entirely. Making a change to the produce delivery does not change the kitchen.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011::49. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best answer here is **(C) Develop a catering menu for department meetings to generate revenue for equipment purchases.** Here's why:

* **Systems thinking** focuses on understanding how different parts of a whole are interconnected and impact each other. It's about seeing the bigger picture and considering the long-term consequences of actions.

Let's analyze each option:

* **(A) Select a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily.**  While a good practice, this focuses on a single element (produce quality) and not the interconnectedness of the system.
* **(B) Reschedule kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations.** This addresses customer needs but doesn't necessarily consider the broader system impacts (e.g., staff workload, ingredient sourcing).
* **(C) Develop a catering menu for department meetings to generate revenue for equipment purchases.**  This option demonstrates systems thinking by:
    * **Identifying a need:** Equipment purchases
    * **Finding a solution within the existing system:** Utilizing kitchen staff and resources to offer catering
    * **Creating a positive feedback loop:** Catering revenue funds equipment, potentially improving food quality and further increasing revenue.
* **(D) Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment.** This is a positive action but focuses narrowly on environmental impact without considering the broader system.

**In summary, option (C) best exemplifies systems thinking by recognizing the interconnectedness of catering, revenue generation, and equipment purchases to improve the overall system (the business) in the long run.**

797. What is the best way to deal with no one responding to a question in a nutrition education group?
A. Request an answer by calling on specific individuals B. Pivot to breaking into small-group discussions C. Make a joke about the silence to make everyone feel more at ease D. Immediately move on to the next topic on the agenda 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Small group or pair-share discussions may help nutrition education participants feel more comfortable in contributing to the conversation. Pivoting to small-group discussions is the best option in this scenario. 

References: Brown University, Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning. Tips on facilitating effective group discussions. Accessed May 2, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best way to deal with this situation is likely a combination of tactics, but here's a breakdown of each option and why some are better than others:

**Less Effective:**

* **D. Immediately move on to the next topic on the agenda:** This might make participants feel like their engagement isn't valued. It also doesn't address the underlying reason for the silence. 

* **A. Request an answer by calling on specific individuals:** This can put people on the spot and make them feel uncomfortable, especially in a group setting. It might lead to short, forced answers rather than genuine engagement.

**More Effective:**

* **C. Make a joke about the silence to make everyone feel more at ease:**  Humor can be a great tool to lighten the mood. A well-placed, gentle joke can break the tension. However, be mindful of the joke's content – it shouldn't be at anyone's expense or make light of the topic.

* **B. Pivot to breaking into small-group discussions:** This is often the most effective approach.  Here's why:
    * **Less pressure:** Small groups encourage participation as people might feel more comfortable sharing in a smaller, less intimidating setting.
    * **Deeper engagement:**  Small-group discussions allow for more in-depth exploration of the topic and can lead to more thoughtful responses.
    * **Identifies roadblocks:** If the silence persists in small groups, it can indicate a need for clarification, a different approach to the topic, or that the group isn't ready to discuss it yet.

**Here's how you could combine these tactics:**

1. **Acknowledge the silence:** "It seems like we might need a moment to gather our thoughts on this one."
2. **Use humor (optional):** "Maybe my question was a bit too much for a Monday morning!" 
3. **Pivot to small groups:** "Let's break into groups of 3-4 and discuss this for 5 minutes.  What are your initial thoughts on [rephrase the question to encourage discussion]?"
4. **Debrief as a large group:**  Bring everyone back together and invite groups to share key takeaways from their discussions.

By using a combination of these techniques, you can create a more welcoming and engaging learning environment for your nutrition education group.

839. In which part of the Nutrition Care Process would an RDN contrast a patient’s actual energy intake with estimated energy needs?
A. Client History B. Food and Nutrition-Related History C. Comparative Standards D. Nutrition Diagnosis 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A patient’s results compared against thresholds of standards is done as part of the Comparative Standards component of a nutrition assessment.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 1:: Nutrition Assessment and Reassessment. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **D. Nutrition Diagnosis**. Here's why:

* **Nutrition Diagnosis** is the step in the Nutrition Care Process where you analyze and interpret the data collected to identify nutrition-related problems. Comparing a patient's actual energy intake with their estimated energy needs is a key part of this analysis.  A discrepancy here could lead to diagnoses like "inadequate energy intake" or "excessive energy intake."

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A. Client History:** This section gathers broad information about the patient's demographics, lifestyle, and medical history. 
* **B. Food and Nutrition-Related History:** This focuses specifically on the patient's dietary habits, intake, and behaviors. While you gather information about actual energy intake here, the comparison and interpretation happen during the diagnosis phase.
* **C. Comparative Standards:** These are reference points like Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) used to assess the adequacy of nutrient intake. While estimated energy needs would fall under comparative standards, the actual comparison happens during diagnosis. 

**In summary:** The Nutrition Diagnosis stage is where you take the data collected (including actual intake and estimated needs) and use it to make professional judgments about the patient's nutritional status.

851. A patient recently diagnosed with acute kidney injury has no evidence of chronic kidney disease but requires hemodialysis. If the patient is a 57-year-old male, weighs 70 kg, has a normal body mass index with no signs or symptoms of malnutrition, and skin is intact, what amount of protein should be recommended?
A. 105 g B. > 140 g C. 56-70 g D. 42 g 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients with acute kidney injury treated with hemodialysis demonstrate positive nitrogen balance with 1.5 g/kg/day of protein. 70 kg × 1.5 = 105 g. The other options underestimate or overestimate protein needs.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Nutrition Care Manual. Acute Renal Failure. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. 56-70 g**. Here's why:

* **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and Protein:** In AKI, protein recommendations need to be carefully considered. While protein restriction is important in chronic kidney disease, it's not always necessary in AKI and can even be detrimental. 

* **Dialysis:** Hemodialysis removes waste products and excess fluid from the blood, but it also removes some protein. 

* **Protein Needs:** Patients on hemodialysis require higher protein intake to compensate for losses.

* **Recommended Intake:** The general recommendation for adults on hemodialysis is 1.2-1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.

**Calculation for this patient:**

* Weight: 70 kg
* Protein needs: 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day
* Lower end of range: 70 kg x 1.2 g/kg/day = 84 g/day
* Upper end of range: 70 kg x 1.5 g/kg/day = 105 g/day

**Important Considerations:**

* **Individualized Care:**  While the calculation provides a range, the exact protein prescription should be determined by a nephrologist or registered dietitian specializing in kidney disease. They will consider the patient's overall health, lab values, and other individual factors.
* **High-Quality Protein:**  Focus on consuming high-quality protein sources like lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, and soy products. 

**Incorrect Answers:**

* **A. 105 g:** This is within the upper range for someone on hemodialysis but might be too high depending on individual factors.
* **B. > 140 g:** This is excessively high and could put unnecessary strain on the kidneys.
* **D. 42 g:** This is too low, especially for someone on hemodialysis, and could lead to malnutrition.

864. A pregnant client met with the RDN several times during the 1st trimester to manage nausea. That client is now in the third trimester and feels healthy and well.  What should the RDN do now?
A. Discontinue this episode of care B. Recommend bloodwork to check iron status C. Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments D. Transition care to another clinician to identify other potential problems 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When patient goals are met, the RDN should discontinue the episode of care.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 3:: Nutrition Intervention. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best answer here is **C. Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments**. Here's why:

* **Nutritional needs change throughout pregnancy:**  A woman's nutritional needs evolve significantly throughout her pregnancy. While the focus in the first trimester might have been managing nausea, the third trimester brings new needs like supporting the baby's rapid growth and ensuring adequate weight gain for the mother. 

* **Iron status is important but not the only factor:** While checking iron status (Option B) is important during pregnancy, it's not the only reason for continued care. An RDN monitors various nutrients, weight gain, and addresses any food-related concerns or complications.

* **Continuity of care is valuable:** Discontinuing care (Option A) or transitioning to another clinician (Option D) without a clear reason disrupts the client-provider relationship and could lead to missed opportunities for education and support.

**In summary:**  Continuing monthly follow-up appointments allows the RDN to:

* Monitor the client's weight gain and adjust dietary recommendations as needed.
* Assess and address any new food aversions or cravings.
* Provide education on appropriate portion sizes and food choices for the third trimester.
* Discuss labor and delivery nutrition, and breastfeeding/formula feeding plans.
* Screen for and address any potential complications like gestational diabetes or pre-eclampsia.

874. During the nutrition assessment, which of the following would an RDN document under Food and Nutrition-Related History to evaluate a client's risk for developing type 2 diabetes?
A. Factors affecting access to physical activity B. Primary language spoken in the home C. Central adiposity D. Blood glucose panel results 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Better neighborhood walkability and greater access to green space has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. These parameters are listed under Food and Nutrition-Related History in the Nutrition Care Process, so factors affecting access to physical activity is the correct answer. Primary language spoken in the home is a Client History assessment parameter, central adiposity is a Nutrition-Focused Physical Finding parameter, and glucose panel results are recorded under Biochemical Data, Medical Tests, and Procedures.

References: den Braver NR, Lakerveld J, Rutters F, et al. Built environmental characteristics and diabetes:: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Nutrition Care Process terminology. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **C. Central adiposity**. Here's why:

* **Central adiposity** (excess fat around the abdomen) is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes.  It's directly related to insulin resistance, a key factor in the development of the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant in this context:

* **A. Factors affecting access to physical activity:** While physical activity is important for overall health and can help prevent type 2 diabetes, it wouldn't be documented under "Food and Nutrition-Related History." This information would fall under "Physical Activity and Function" or a similar category.
* **B. Primary language spoken in the home:** This is important for communication and culturally appropriate care but doesn't directly relate to diabetes risk assessment. This information would be documented under "Client History" or "Demographics."
* **D. Blood glucose panel results:**  These are crucial for diagnosing diabetes and monitoring blood sugar control. However, they are considered part of "Biochemical Data, Medical Tests, and Procedures" and not "Food and Nutrition-Related History."

**In summary:** An RDN focuses on dietary and nutrition-related factors when assessing diabetes risk. Central adiposity is a key indicator within that scope.

887. What should happen if a shelter-in-place order is imposed during business hours?
A. Change the business’ voicemail message to acknowledge the emergency situation B. Keep the business open to not lose revenue in case the order was a false alarm C. Ask any non-staff visitors/customers to leave the premises to avoid liability issues D. Gather everyone near the windows so they can keep watch on what is happening outside 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Shelter-in-place orders might be imposed if a natural disaster occurs or if chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants are released into the environment. Shelter-in-place orders apply to everyone present at the business, so even customers should be asked to stay. It is recommended that businesses immediately close and change the voicemail recording to indicate that the business is closed and that staff and visitors will remain in the building until it is deemed safe to leave.

References: US Department of Labor. Evacuation plans and procedures eTools. Accessed January 14, 2022. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The most important thing during a shelter-in-place order is the safety of everyone on the premises. Here's a breakdown of the options and why the best answer is **C**:

* **A. Change the business’ voicemail message to acknowledge the emergency situation** 
    * While it's a good idea to eventually update communication channels, it's not the priority during the initial moments of a shelter-in-place order. 

* **B. Keep the business open to not lose revenue in case the order was a false alarm**
    * **Never prioritize revenue over safety.** A shelter-in-place order is a serious instruction, and assuming it's a false alarm puts people at risk.

* **C. Ask any non-staff visitors/customers to leave the premises to avoid liability issues**
    * **This is the most appropriate immediate action.**  Having non-essential personnel leave allows you to account for staff and secure the building more quickly. Liability is a concern, but the primary reason is safety.

* **D. Gather everyone near the windows so they can keep watch on what is happening outside**
    * **This is dangerous.** Depending on the nature of the emergency, being visible or near windows could put people at risk.

**Here's what you should do if a shelter-in-place order is imposed during business hours:**

1. **Immediately follow the instructions of authorities.** This might come through official channels like emergency broadcasts, sirens, or law enforcement.
2. **Secure the premises:** Lock all exterior doors and windows.
3. **Account for all employees and visitors.**  Ask non-essential personnel to leave if it's safe to do so.
4. **Move everyone to a designated safe area** away from windows and exterior walls, if one is identified in your emergency plan.
5. **Turn off lights and minimize noise.**
6. **Stay informed and await further instructions.** Use a radio, TV, or official mobile alerts for updates.

**Remember:**  Your business should have a pre-established emergency plan that includes procedures for a shelter-in-place order.

913. Which of the following is classified as a body compartment estimate in the Nutrition Care Process?
A. Bone age B. Estimated fat intake C. Inadequate energy intake D. 24-hour fecal fat 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: In the Nutrition Care Process, body compartment estimates are classified under anthropometric measurements. Bone age is an anthropometric measurement. Estimated fat intake is a food- and nutrition-related history parameter, 24-hour fecal fat is a biochemical data parameter, and inadequate energy intake is a nutrition diagnosis. 

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 1:: Nutrition assessment and reassessment. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. Inadequate energy intake**. Here's why:

* **Body compartment estimates** in the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) refer to assessments of different components within the body, such as body fat, muscle mass, and fluid levels. These estimates help determine a person's nutritional status and needs.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A. Bone age:**  Bone age is a measure of skeletal maturity, not a body compartment.
* **B. Estimated fat intake:** This refers to dietary intake, not a direct assessment of body composition.
* **D. 24-hour fecal fat:** This test measures fat malabsorption, not a body compartment.

**Inadequate energy intake** is a conclusion drawn from assessing various factors, including body compartment estimates (like unintentional weight loss or low muscle mass). It suggests the body isn't receiving enough calories to meet its needs.

914. Which of the following is the fork drip test for IDDSI Level 4 Pureed/Extremely Thick?
A. Scooped sample sits in mound on fork and does not drip easily through prongs B. Small sample amount drips continuously through the prongs C. Sample drips slowly in dollops through the prongs, which do not leave a clear pattern D. Sample shows no sign of dripping through the prongs 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The fork drip test for the Level 4 Pureed/Extremely Thick diet of the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative requires that a scooped sample sits in mound on the fork and does not drip easily through prongs.

References: International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative. IDDSI Framework. Accessed March 13, 2020. Available at:: 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. Sample drips slowly in dollops through the prongs, which do not leave a clear pattern.**

Here's why:

* **IDDSI Level 4 Pureed/Extremely Thick** foods are smooth, cohesive, and require some effort to eat. They should be spoonable but not pourable.

* **The fork drip test** helps determine the flow and texture of a food. For Level 4, the food should be thick enough to cling together but still flow slowly off a fork. 

Let's break down the other options:

* **A. Scooped sample sits in mound on fork and does not drip easily through prongs:** This describes a thicker consistency, likely IDDSI Level 5 Minced & Moist.
* **B. Small sample amount drips continuously through the prongs:** This indicates a thinner consistency, likely IDDSI Level 3 Liquidised/Moderately Thick.
* **D. Sample shows no sign of dripping through the prongs:** This describes a very thick consistency, likely IDDSI Level 6 Soft & Bite-Sized or beyond. 

**Remember:** The fork drip test is just one tool for assessing IDDSI levels. Always refer to the complete IDDSI framework for accurate classification.

916. According to the Nutrition Care Process, if a client takes self-prescribed therapeutic doses of vitamin C, this information should be recorded in the _____ section of the Nutrition Assessment.
A. intake B. client history C. behavioral-environmental D. nutrition knowledge 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Any ingestion would be evaluated as part of the Intake category within Nutrition Assessment. Although the decision to self-prescribe could be related to the influence of attitudes and beliefs, behavioral-environmental parameters are a component of Nutrition Diagnosis in the Nutrition Care Process.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Nutrition Care Process Step 1:: Nutrition Assessment. Accessed November 8, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **A. intake**. Here's why:

* **Intake** refers to the actual consumption of food and nutrients.  Recording the self-prescribed vitamin C in the intake section accurately reflects the client's current nutrient intake, even if it's from a supplement.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Client history** would include past medical conditions, surgeries, or dietary habits, not current supplement use.
* **Behavioral-environmental** focuses on factors influencing food choices, access to food, and lifestyle factors. While self-prescribing might be considered a behavior, the focus is on the actual intake of the vitamin.
* **Nutrition knowledge** assesses the client's understanding of nutrition principles. While the client's choice to take vitamin C might stem from some nutrition knowledge, it doesn't directly reflect their overall understanding. 

**In summary:**  The Nutrition Care Process emphasizes accurately capturing the client's current dietary intake, including supplements, in the intake section.

934. Which of the following is best practice for writing a job description?
A. Target it specifically for the ideal candidate B. Present all information as short phrases in bulleted lists C. Include responsibilities no longer part of the job in case they are restored as requirements in the future D. Limit the job duties section to only 3-5 key responsibilities  

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In best practice, a job description will include only 3-5 key responsibilities in the duties section. The description should be tailored to the basic skills and experience required of the job rather than targeting it for an ideal candidate, and it should only include what is currently required of the job and omit past or potential future requirements. Using complete sentences is recommended.

References: University of Pittsburgh, Department of Human Resources. Writing a job description. Accessed February 13, 2020. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best answer here is **A. Target it specifically for the ideal candidate.** Here's why:

* **Targeting the Ideal Candidate:** A job description should be more than just a list of tasks. It should paint a picture of the role, the company culture, and what kind of person would thrive in that environment. This helps attract candidates who are genuinely a good fit.

Let's look at why the other options aren't best practices:

* **B. Present all information as short phrases in bulleted lists:** While bullet points are great for readability, relying on them exclusively can make the description feel dry and impersonal. 
* **C. Include responsibilities no longer part of the job:** This is misleading and can lead to confusion for both candidates and those involved in the hiring process.
* **D. Limit the job duties section to only 3-5 key responsibilities:**  While being concise is important, limiting the description to only 3-5 responsibilities can be too vague. It's important to provide enough detail for candidates to understand the scope of the role.

**In addition to targeting the ideal candidate, a good job description should also include:**

* **A compelling job title:**  Grab attention and accurately reflect the role.
* **A brief company overview:**  Showcase your company culture and values.
* **Clear and specific responsibilities:**  Use action verbs and provide enough detail.
* **Required and preferred qualifications:**  Be realistic but aspirational.
* **Information about salary and benefits:** Be transparent to attract top talent.
* **A call to action:**  Tell candidates how to apply.

937. Which of the following is characterized by customers selecting items from both displays and service counters and paying for those items at a centralized location within the establishment?
A. Takeout service B. Table service C. Self service D. Counter service 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Rationale: Self service is characterized by customers choosing what they want from displayed items and service counters and paying for the items in a centralized location within the establishment. Table service is provided by waitstaff. Counter service is characterized by efficiency and a structure wherein orders are placed with a counter attendant. Takeout service is characterized by consumers purchasing food in one location and enjoying their purchase at another location of their choosing. 

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017::206-208. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. Self service**. Here's why:

* **Self service** is a system where customers perform many of the tasks themselves, including selecting items, and then proceed to a central point for payment. This is typical of grocery stores, cafeterias, and some retail environments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Takeout service** implies food prepared for consumption off-premises. While takeout often involves selecting items, it doesn't necessarily dictate a centralized payment location.
* **Table service** involves customers being seated and served by staff who take orders and deliver food.
* **Counter service** involves customers ordering and receiving items directly at a counter, often with separate payment at the same location.

977. What does a fasting blood glucose (FBG) of 129 indicate?
A. Normal blood sugar B. Diabetes C. Sugar spilling over into the urine D. Pre-diabetes 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A fasting blood glucose of 126 or higher indicates diabetes

References: American Diabetes Association. Standards of medical care in diabetes—2023. Diabetes Care. Accessed July 5, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **D. Pre-diabetes**. Here's why:

* **Normal blood sugar:** A fasting blood glucose level less than 100 mg/dL is considered normal.
* **Pre-diabetes:** A fasting blood glucose level from 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL is considered pre-diabetes.
* **Diabetes:** A fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests is generally diagnosed as diabetes.

**Important Note:** While an FBG of 129 is a strong indicator of pre-diabetes, a doctor will use this information along with other tests and factors to make a definitive diagnosis. 

**Sugar spilling over into the urine** is a symptom of diabetes that usually occurs at higher blood sugar levels.

984. Which of the following would be considered a transitional food according to the IDDSI framework?
A. Honey B. Ice cream C. Oatmeal D. Pudding 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: "Transitional foods" are substances that change quickly to become easier to chew or swallow with added moisture (eg, water or saliva) or a change in temperature. According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative framework, frozen desserts such as ice cream, sherbet, malts, and frozen yogurt and some potato chips are considered transitional foods.

References: International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative. What are transitional foods? Accessed September 22, 2019. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **(C) Oatmeal**. Here's why:

* **IDDSI (International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative)** focuses on making food and drinks safe and easier to swallow for people with dysphagia (swallowing difficulties).

* **Transitional foods** in the IDDSI framework are those that are soft, moist, easily mashed, and require some chewing ability. They bridge the gap between smooth, puréed foods and regular textured foods.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A. Honey:**  While viscous, honey is sticky and can be difficult to swallow safely.
* **B. Ice cream:**  Ice cream can melt into a thin liquid, posing a choking hazard.
* **C. Oatmeal:** When cooked properly, oatmeal is soft, moist, and can be easily mashed. It requires some chewing but breaks down easily.
* **D. Pudding:**  Pudding is generally smooth and doesn't require much chewing, making it more characteristic of Level 3 (Moderate Thick) in the IDDSI framework.

**Therefore, oatmeal best fits the description of a transitional food within the IDDSI framework.**

1006. Improper food cooling methods can result in foodborne illness. Which of the following is the recommended time frame for cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF?
A. 1/2 hour B. 1 hour C. 2 hours D. 4 hours 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF should be done within 4 hours. Cooling foods from 140ºF to 70ºF should be completed within 2 hours. Proper food cooling techniques include use of shallow pans to reduce and divide the food, stainless steel storage containers to transfer heat from the food, and ice cubes. 

References: National Restaurant Association. Servsafe manager. Chicago, IL:: NRA Educational Foundation; 2014:: 6.16. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **C. 2 hours**. Here's why:

* **The Danger Zone:** Bacteria that cause foodborne illness thrive in the temperature range of 41°F to 135°F (5°C to 57°C). This is often called the "danger zone." 
* **Rapid Cooling:**  To minimize the time food spends in the danger zone, it needs to be cooled from 70°F to 41°F as quickly as possible, and always within 2 hours.
* **4-Hour Rule:** The total time food spends in the danger zone (including cooling and reheating) should not exceed 4 hours.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **A. 1/2 hour:** While ideal, it's often difficult to cool large quantities of food this quickly.
* **B. 1 hour:** Still too slow. Food could spend too much time in the danger zone.
* **D. 4 hours:**  This is the maximum total time allowed in the danger zone, not just for cooling. Cooling this slowly significantly increases the risk of bacterial growth. 

**Tips for Safe Cooling:**

* **Shallow containers:** Divide large amounts of food into smaller, shallower containers for faster cooling.
* **Ice baths:** Place containers of food in an ice bath to cool them rapidly.
* **Blast chiller:**  Commercial kitchens often use blast chillers to cool food quickly and safely.

1009. Which of the following is highest in carbohydrate?
A. 3 cups air-popped popcorn, plain B. ½ cup cooked oatmeal, plain C. 2 cups milk D. ½ cup cooked corn 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Among the options listed, 2 cups milk is the highest in carbohydrate. 

References: US Department of Agriculture. Food Data Central. Accessed June 30, 2023. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **B. ½ cup cooked oatmeal, plain**. Here's why:

* **Carbohydrates are the primary component of grains.** Oatmeal and popcorn are both grains, while milk and corn have other primary components (protein and sugar, respectively).

* **½ cup of cooked oatmeal is a more concentrated source of grains** than 3 cups of air-popped popcorn. Popcorn is mostly air, which is why it has a much larger volume for a similar amount of carbohydrates.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A. 3 cups air-popped popcorn, plain:** While popcorn does contain carbohydrates, 3 cups is a deceivingly large volume. The air in popcorn makes the serving size seem much larger than the actual amount of grain.
* **C. 2 cups milk:** Milk contains carbohydrates in the form of lactose (milk sugar), but it's not as carbohydrate-rich as grains. 
* **D. ½ cup cooked corn:** Corn is a starchy vegetable and contains carbohydrates, but it's lower in carbohydrates compared to the same volume of cooked oatmeal.

**Important Note:** This is a general comparison. The exact carbohydrate content can vary slightly depending on the specific brand and preparation method.

1033. Which of the following is best practice when translating educational materials from English to another language in a culturally sensitive way?
A. Contract with a native speaker of the language to do the translation B. Avoid translating until the text is written well in English C. Contract with one reviewer to check for cultural and linguistic appropriateness D. Translate the content word for word 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Rationale: Before translating a document, it should be written well in English, because if the original English text is too difficult, the translated text will probably also be too difficult. It cannot be assumed that native speakers of a given language are skilled at writing or at translating, so the person contracted to translate should it is more important that the translator be a professional translator than simply a native speaker. More than one individual should review the translation. Word-for-word, or literal, translations do not account for linguistic and cultural differences. 

References: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Toolkit for Making Written Material Clear and Effective:: Detailed guide for translations. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best answer is **(C) Contract with one reviewer to check for cultural and linguistic appropriateness**. Here's why:

* **(A) Contract with a native speaker of the language to do the translation** While using a native speaker is essential, it's only one part of the process.  A native speaker might not be familiar with the nuances of educational terminology or cultural sensitivity in an educational context.

* **(B) Avoid translating until the text is written well in English**  A well-written English text is a good starting point, but it doesn't guarantee a culturally sensitive translation. The translation process itself often reveals areas where the original text can be adapted for better cultural understanding.

* **(D) Translate the content word for word** This is almost always a bad idea. Languages have different structures and idioms. Word-for-word translation leads to awkward, confusing, and sometimes offensive results.

**Why (C) is the best:**

* **Cultural Understanding:** A reviewer focused on cultural appropriateness will ensure the material resonates with the target audience, avoids offensive content, and considers cultural norms in education.
* **Linguistic Accuracy:** They will also check for natural language flow, appropriate terminology for the educational level, and overall clarity.

**Important Note:** Ideally, you'd want both a skilled translator who is a native speaker *and* a separate reviewer for cultural and linguistic appropriateness. This two-step process ensures the highest quality and culturally sensitive translation.

1049. Prolonged use of PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) such as omeprazole can lead to which of the following?
A. Bone fractures B. Polyps C. Constipation D. Vitamin D deficiency 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Rationale: PPIs have been overprescribed and recent guidelines have directed providers when benefits outweighs risk. Gastric acid secretion can facilitate calcium absorption and acid suppressants such as PPI can decrease calcium absorption and bone density.

References: Freedberg, DE Kim L, Yu-Xiao, Y:: The risks and benefits of long term use of proton pump inhibitors:: expert review and best practice advice from the American Gastroenterological Association. Gastroenterology. 2017;152(4):: 706-715. Accessed July 10, 2020. Kinoshita Y, Ishimura N, Ishihara S. Advantages and disadvantages of long-term proton pump inhibitor use. J Neurogastroenterol Motil. 2018;24(2)::182-196. Accessed July 14, 2020. Available at::  

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The answer is **A. Bone fractures** and **D. Vitamin D deficiency**. Here's why:

* **Bone Fractures:** Long-term PPI use has been linked to a slightly increased risk of bone fractures, particularly in the hip, wrist, and spine. This is because PPIs can interfere with calcium absorption, which is essential for bone health.

* **Vitamin D Deficiency:** PPIs can also interfere with the absorption of vitamin D, which is important for calcium absorption and bone health. This can contribute to a deficiency over time.

**Let's look at the other options:**

* **Polyps:** While PPIs can contribute to a condition called fundic gland polyps in the stomach, these are generally benign and not a major concern. PPIs are not directly linked to the development of other types of polyps.

* **Constipation:** Constipation is not a common side effect of PPI use. In fact, some people might experience mild diarrhea as a side effect.

**Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. If you have concerns about PPI use or potential side effects, please consult with a healthcare professional.

139. Which of the following changes occurs at an earlier Tanner stage for girls than for boys?
A. Peak height velocity B. Voice changes C. Development of axillary hair D. Increased sweat gland activity 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Peak height velocity begins at Tanner stage 2 for girls, whereas it begins at Tanner stage 3 for boys. Sweat gland activity increases for both boys and girls during stage 2, axillary hair development begins for both boys and girls during stage 3, and voice changes are not delineated in the Tanner stages for girls.

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **(C) Development of axillary hair**. Here's why:

* **Tanner Stages** are a system used to describe the physical development of children and adolescents during puberty.  Girls generally begin puberty earlier than boys.

Let's break down each option:

* **A. Peak height velocity:** Girls typically experience their peak height velocity (growth spurt) earlier than boys, but both occur around Tanner Stage 3-4.
* **B. Voice changes:** Voice changes are a later pubertal development for both sexes, occurring around Tanner Stage 4 for boys and often even later for girls.
* **C. Development of axillary hair:**  Axillary (underarm) hair development is one of the earliest signs of puberty in girls, often appearing at Tanner Stage 2. In boys, it usually appears later, around Tanner Stage 3.
* **D. Increased sweat gland activity:** While sweat gland activity increases during puberty for both sexes, it's not as clearly linked to specific Tanner stages as other changes.

**In summary:** The development of axillary hair is a more reliable indicator of earlier pubertal development in girls compared to boys when using the Tanner stages.

245. HACCP principles must be considered in order. Which of the following is the fourth principle?
A. Establish critical limits B. Establish monitoring procedures C. Establish procedures for record keeping and documentation D. Verify that the system works 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan is a system that identifies, evaluates, and controls hazards that are significant for food safety. The steps in order are: (1) Conduct a hazard analysis. (2) Determine critical control points. (3) Establish critical limits. (4) Establish monitoring procedures. (5) Identify corrective actions. (6) Verify that the system works. (7) Establish procedures for record keeping and documentation.

References: National Restaurant Association Education Foundation. ServSafe Coursebook. 6th ed. Chicago:: NRA; 2012:: 10-4. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The correct answer is **(B) Establish monitoring procedures**.

Here's why, and how it fits into the order of HACCP principles:

**HACCP Principles in Order:**

1. **Conduct a Hazard Analysis:** Identify potential hazards in the food production process.
2. **Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs):**  Pinpoint the steps where hazards can be controlled or eliminated.
3. **Establish Critical Limits:** Define the minimum or maximum values for each CCP to ensure safety (e.g., temperature, time).
4. **Establish Monitoring Procedures:**  Set up systems to track and measure if CCPs are under control (e.g., regular temperature checks).
5. **Establish Corrective Actions:** Determine steps to take if monitoring shows a CCP is not under control.
6. **Establish Procedures for Record Keeping and Documentation:** Maintain records to demonstrate HACCP plan effectiveness.
7. **Verify that the System Works:** Regularly review the HACCP system, validate its effectiveness, and make adjustments as needed.

930. What number of productive FTEs are needed for two 7-day-per-week positions, working 6:30 am to 3:00 pm, with a 30-minute lunch?
A. 1.4 B. 2 C. 2.8 D. 2.975 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 2 * 8 hours * 7 days = 112 hours/ 40 hours week = 2.8 FTES

References: Keiser J, DeMicco FJ. Contemporary Management Theory:: Controlling and Analyzing Costs in Foodservice Operations. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice Hall; 2000::260. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

Here's how to calculate the FTEs:

**1. Calculate Daily Work Hours:**

* Each employee works 8 hours per day (6:30 am to 3:00 pm) minus a 30-minute lunch break.
* 8 hours - 0.5 hours = 7.5 hours per day

**2. Calculate Weekly Work Hours:**

* Each employee works 7 days a week.
* 7.5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 52.5 hours per week

**3. Calculate Total Weekly Hours:**

* Two employees are needed.
* 52.5 hours/week/employee * 2 employees = 105 hours per week

**4. Calculate FTEs:**

* A full-time equivalent (FTE) is typically considered 40 hours per week.
* 105 total weekly hours / 40 hours/FTE = 2.625 FTEs

**Therefore, the closest answer is C. 2.8 FTEs.**

447. Which of the following is an example of focus strategy?
A. Hospital nutrition services revises all patient menus to reflect condition-specific recommendations and restrictions B. Hospital convenes a consumer panel to offer feedback on proposed foodservice offerings C. Hospital begins marketing home meal replacements and delivery for its hospital staff D. Hospital system consolidates its dietary department managerial staff to be housed in one location 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Focus strategy uses a cost leadership or differentiation strategy to target a specific, limited-size market niche. This approach is exemplified in a hospital's plan to market home meal replacements and delivery for its hospital staff.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Gemini 1.5 Pro Response: 

The best example of a focus strategy here is **C. Hospital begins marketing home meal replacements and delivery for its hospital staff.**

Here's why:

* **Focus Strategy:**  A focus strategy concentrates on a narrow market segment within a larger industry. Businesses using this strategy aim to become experts in meeting the specific needs and preferences of that chosen segment.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A. Hospital nutrition services revises all patient menus...** This is an operational improvement focusing on quality and customization but doesn't necessarily target a specific niche market.
* **B. Hospital convenes a consumer panel...** This is market research and valuable for gathering feedback, but not a focus strategy in itself.
* **C. Hospital begins marketing home meal replacements and delivery for its hospital staff.** This option targets a very specific niche: hospital staff. They are focusing their marketing efforts and potentially tailoring their product (home meal replacements) to appeal to the needs of this group (convenience, healthy options after long shifts, etc.).
* **D. Hospital system consolidates its dietary department managerial staff...** This is an organizational restructuring move aimed at efficiency and doesn't represent a focus strategy.

**In conclusion:** Option C demonstrates a focus strategy by identifying and targeting a specific customer segment (hospital staff) with a tailored product/service offering.
