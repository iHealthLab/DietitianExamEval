32. Which food is most likely to deteriorate due to hydrolytic rancidity during storage at room temperature?
A. Fish oil B. Soybean oil C. Olive oil D. Butter 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Hydrolytic rancidity occurs when water splits fatty acid chains away from the glycerol backbone in triglycerides (fats). The chemical term is ester hydrolysis. Usually this hydrolysis process goes unnoticed, since most fatty acids are odorless and tasteless. However, when the triglyceride is derived from short-chain fatty acids, the released carboxylic acid can confer strong flavors and odors. A particular problem arises with butter, which contains triglycerides with a high content of butyric acid derivatives and acetic acids.

References: Brown AC. Understanding Food:: Principles and Preparation. 5th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2014. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The food most likely to deteriorate due to hydrolytic rancidity during storage at room temperature is:

A. Fish oil

Explanation:
Hydrolytic rancidity occurs when water reacts with the triglycerides in fats or oils, breaking them down into free fatty acids and glycerol. This process is accelerated by the presence of enzymes called lipases and by exposure to moisture, heat, and light.

Fish oil is particularly susceptible to hydrolytic rancidity because:

1. It contains a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are more prone to oxidation and hydrolysis compared to monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids.

2. Fish oil often contains enzymes that can catalyze the hydrolysis of triglycerides.

3. Fish oil is usually less refined and may contain more impurities that can promote rancidity.

In contrast, soybean oil and olive oil, while still susceptible to rancidity, are more stable than fish oil due to their lower PUFA content and higher levels of natural antioxidants (such as tocopherols and polyphenols).

Butter, being a water-in-oil emulsion, is less likely to undergo hydrolytic rancidity compared to pure oils. However, it can still develop off-flavors due to oxidative rancidity and microbial growth.

39. Which produce is most likely to brown in a refrigerator?
A. Green peppers B. Onions C. Bananas D. Avocados 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Bananas have a fast ripening rate and low tolerance to refrigeration, which can result in external and internal browning and, as a consequence, affect consumer acceptability and processing suitability. Avocados can be safely stored in a refrigerator upon ripening without advancing the browning process. 

References: Escalante-Minakata P, Ibarra-Junguera V, de Jesus Ornelas-Paz, J, et al. Comparative study of the banana pulp browning process of ‘Giant Dwarf’ and FHIA-23 during fruit ripening based on image analysis and the polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase biochemical properties. 3 Biotech. 2018;8(1)::30. Accessed August 12, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Avocados.

Explanation:
Avocados are the most likely to brown among the given options when stored in a refrigerator. This is because avocados contain an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase, which reacts with oxygen and causes the flesh to turn brown when exposed to air. This process is called enzymatic browning.

While refrigeration can slow down the ripening process of avocados, it does not completely stop the browning reaction once the fruit has been cut or the skin has been damaged. The cold temperature in the refrigerator can even accelerate the browning process in some cases.

As for the other options:
A. Green peppers: They can last for several days in the refrigerator without significant browning.
B. Onions: They can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks without browning.
C. Bananas: They are best stored at room temperature and can brown faster when refrigerated due to the cold temperature causing the skin to darken.

55. Approximately how many grams of fat would be contained in an 800 kcal meal that provides 50% of the energy from carbohydrates, 20% from protein, and the remainder from fat?
A. 89 B. 240 C. 27 D. 296 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: If the meal contains 50% carbohydrate and 20% protein, then the meal contains 30% (0.30) fat. 800 kcal x 0.30 = 240 kcal from fat. 240 kcal ÷ 9 kcal per gram of fat = 26.66 or 27 g fat.

References: Whitney EN, Rolfes S. Understanding Nutrition. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1) First, let's understand what the question is asking. We need to find out how many grams of fat are in an 800 kcal meal where:
   - 50% of the energy comes from carbohydrates
   - 20% of the energy comes from protein
   - The rest of the energy comes from fat

2) We know that:
   - 1 gram of carbohydrate provides 4 kcal
   - 1 gram of protein provides 4 kcal
   - 1 gram of fat provides 9 kcal

3) Let's calculate the energy from carbohydrates:
   - 50% of 800 kcal = 0.5 × 800 = 400 kcal from carbohydrates
   - 400 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 100 grams of carbohydrates

4) Now, let's calculate the energy from protein:
   - 20% of 800 kcal = 0.2 × 800 = 160 kcal from protein
   - 160 kcal ÷ 4 kcal/g = 40 grams of protein

5) The remaining energy comes from fat:
   - Remaining percentage = 100% - 50% - 20% = 30%
   - 30% of 800 kcal = 0.3 × 800 = 240 kcal from fat
   - 240 kcal ÷ 9 kcal/g ≈ 26.7 grams of fat

Therefore, the meal contains approximately 27 grams of fat (rounded from 26.7). The correct answer is C.
--------------------


60. Which of the following foods contains approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate?
A. 1 English muffin B. ½ cup mashed potatoes C. 4 cups popped popcorn D. 1 large banana 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: One exchange of starch or fruit each has about 15 g carbohydrate. There are approximately 15 g carbohydrate in a ½ cup of mashed potatoes. For the other options to have 15 g carbohydrate, the serving sizes would need to be ½ an English muffin, 3 cups popped popcorn, and 1 small (4 oz) banana.

References: American Dietetic Association and American Diabetes Association. Count Your Carbs:: Getting Started. Chicago:: ADA; 2010::14. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine which food contains approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate, let's examine each option:

A. 1 English muffin:
   - One English muffin typically contains around 25-30 grams of carbohydrate.

B. ½ cup mashed potatoes:
   - Half a cup of mashed potatoes usually contains about 15-20 grams of carbohydrate.

C. 4 cups popped popcorn:
   - Four cups of popped popcorn generally contain around 20-25 grams of carbohydrate.

D. 1 large banana:
   - A large banana (about 8-9 inches long) typically contains approximately 30-35 grams of carbohydrate.

Based on this information, the food that contains approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate is:

B. ½ cup mashed potatoes

While the exact carbohydrate content may vary slightly depending on the recipe and preparation method, half a cup of mashed potatoes is the closest to 15 grams of carbohydrate among the given options.

65. One disadvantage to adding baking soda to green beans or broccoli is that
A. the vegetables' texture becomes mushy and soft. B. the vegetables lose fat-soluble vitamins. C. the vegetables will dull in or lose color. D. the vegetables will taste extremely salty. 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The baking soda interacts with the chlorophyll and actually enhances the green color rather than dull it. The addition of baking soda usually does not result in a salty taste; however, it will destroy water-soluble (but not fat-soluble) vitamins. The baking soda has a softening effect on the vegetables, which causes them to get mushy.

References: Edelstein S. Food Science:: An Ecological Approach. Burlington, MA:: Jones and Bartlett; 2013 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. the vegetables will dull in or lose color.

Explanation:
When baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is added to the cooking water for green vegetables like green beans or broccoli, it increases the pH level, making the water more alkaline. This alkaline environment causes the chlorophyll in the vegetables to break down more quickly, resulting in the loss of the bright green color.

Let's examine the other options:

A. The vegetables' texture becomes mushy and soft: Adding baking soda to the cooking water can actually help maintain the texture of the vegetables by slowing down the breakdown of pectin, which helps keep the vegetables firm.

B. The vegetables lose fat-soluble vitamins: While some vitamins, such as vitamin C, can be lost during cooking, adding baking soda does not specifically cause the loss of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).

D. The vegetables will taste extremely salty: Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, not sodium chloride (table salt). While it may contribute a slightly salty taste, it will not make the vegetables taste extremely salty.

83. Which of the following is a typical characteristic of olive oil that is extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed?
A. Stronger color intensity B. Stronger aroma C. Lower content of free fatty acids D. Watery 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Olive oil obtained from this kind of process (extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed) is usually characterized by stronger color intensity, weaker aroma, and a higher content of free fatty acids

References: Whitney EN, Rolfes S. Understanding Nutrition. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Lower content of free fatty acids.

Explanation:
Olive oil that undergoes additional processing steps like extrusion, post-pressuring, and re-pressing typically has a lower content of free fatty acids compared to virgin or extra virgin olive oil.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Stronger color intensity: Additional processing steps like extrusion and re-pressing do not necessarily lead to a stronger color intensity. In fact, such processing can sometimes result in a lighter color due to the removal of pigments.

B. Stronger aroma: The aroma of olive oil is largely determined by the presence of volatile compounds. Additional processing steps can actually lead to a loss of these compounds, resulting in a milder aroma.

D. Watery: Olive oil that has been extruded, post-pressured, and re-pressed is not typically watery. These processing steps are designed to extract more oil from the olive pulp, not to add water to the oil.

In summary, olive oil that has undergone additional processing steps like extrusion, post-pressuring, and re-pressing is characterized by a lower content of free fatty acids compared to virgin or extra virgin olive oil.

94. What is the usual purpose of summative evaluation?
A. To compare the extent of learning between and among learners B. To reduce the cost-benefit ratio of teaching and learning C. To improve the program's delivery and effectiveness D. To determine opportunities for expansion and enhancement of entrepreneurship in education 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Summative evaluation takes place after the implementation of a program and is associated with more objective, quantitative methods. It is used to assess whether the program has met its goals, whether there were any unintended consequences, and how to improve.

References: Boyle MA, Holben DH. Community Nutrition in Action:: An Entrepreneurial Approach. 6th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The usual purpose of summative evaluation is:

A. To compare the extent of learning between and among learners

Summative evaluation is typically conducted at the end of a course, program, or learning unit to assess and compare the overall learning outcomes achieved by the students. Its main goal is to measure the effectiveness of the instructional process by determining the extent to which the learners have acquired the intended knowledge, skills, and competencies.

The other options:

B. To reduce the cost-benefit ratio of teaching and learning - This is not the primary purpose of summative evaluation. While the results of summative evaluation may be used to make decisions about resource allocation, its main focus is on assessing learning outcomes.

C. To improve the program's delivery and effectiveness - This is usually the purpose of formative evaluation, which is conducted during the learning process to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments.

D. To determine opportunities for expansion and enhancement of entrepreneurship in education - Summative evaluation is not directly related to entrepreneurship in education. Its focus is on assessing learning outcomes and the effectiveness of the instructional process.

A. education B. empathy C. explanation D. expectations 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: In the ETHNIC model, explanation about the culture and condition or illness by the client is the first step.

References: Stein K. Moving cultural competency from abstract to act. J Am Diet Assoc. 2010; 110(2):: 180-187. 

Claude 3 Response: 

In the ETHNIC model of culturally competent care, the "E" stands for Explanation.

The ETHNIC model is a mnemonic device used to help healthcare providers remember the key components of providing culturally competent care. The letters in ETHNIC stand for:

E - Explanation
T - Treatment
H - Healers
N - Negotiate
I - Intervention
C - Collaboration

Explanation refers to the process of clearly explaining the patient's condition, treatment options, and expected outcomes in a way that is understandable and culturally appropriate for the patient and their family.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Explanation.

A. Identifying whether or not intake is inadequate or excessive compared to actual or estimated needs. B. Assessing nutrition problems that relate to medical or physical conditions. C. Interpreting laboratory data and tests. D. Implementing appropriate nutrition interventions that are tailored to the patient/client's needs. 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The nutrition care process comprises ADIME (assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring and evaluation); intervention is the third step.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 3:: Nutrition intervention. Accessed November 8, 2023.  

Claude 3 Response: 

The third step in the Nutrition Care Process is Nutrition Intervention. The correct answer to the question is:

D. Implementing appropriate nutrition interventions that are tailored to the patient/client's needs.

The Nutrition Care Process consists of four distinct steps:

1. Nutrition Assessment: This step involves collecting and analyzing relevant data, including dietary intake, anthropometric measurements, biochemical data, medical tests, and treatment goals.

2. Nutrition Diagnosis: In this step, the dietitian identifies and labels existing nutrition problems that require intervention based on the assessment data.

3. Nutrition Intervention: This step involves planning and implementing appropriate actions to address the nutrition diagnosis. Interventions may include nutrition education, counseling, meal planning, and collaboration with other healthcare professionals.

4. Nutrition Monitoring and Evaluation: The final step is to monitor progress, measure outcomes, and assess the effectiveness of the nutrition intervention. The dietitian will then adjust the intervention plan as needed.

Options A, B, and C are all tasks completed during the Nutrition Assessment step (step 1), not the Nutrition Intervention step (step 3).

130. What would the nitrogen balance be for a patient with a 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion of 14.3 grams and a protein intake of 102 grams?
A. +16.3 grams B. −16.3 grams C. −2 grams D. +2 grams 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Nitrogen balance formula: total protein intake (g)/6.25 g – (UUN + 4 g for insensible losses)

References: Boullata J, Carney LN, Guenter P. A.S.P.E.N. Enteral Nutrition Handbook. Silver Spring, MD:: American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition; 2010::26. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To solve this problem, let's first understand what nitrogen balance is and how to calculate it.

Nitrogen balance is the difference between the amount of nitrogen taken in (from protein in the diet) and the amount of nitrogen excreted (primarily in urine, but also in feces, skin, and other losses). A positive nitrogen balance indicates that the body is retaining more nitrogen than it's excreting, which is typical during periods of growth or muscle building. A negative nitrogen balance suggests that the body is breaking down more protein than it's taking in.

Given:
- 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion = 14.3 grams
- Protein intake = 102 grams

Step 1: Convert protein intake to nitrogen intake.
Protein contains about 16% nitrogen by weight. So, to convert protein to nitrogen, multiply the protein intake by 0.16.

Nitrogen intake = 102 grams × 0.16 = 16.32 grams

Step 2: Calculate the nitrogen balance.
Nitrogen balance = Nitrogen intake - Nitrogen excretion
Nitrogen balance = 16.32 grams - 14.3 grams = 2.02 grams

Therefore, the nitrogen balance is approximately +2 grams, which corresponds to answer choice D.

133. Approximately how many carbohydrate servings are 48 grapes?
A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 4 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: There are roughly 15 grapes in 1 carbohydrate serving, so 48 grapes would provide approximately 3 carbohydrate servings.

References: Rolfes SR, Pinna K, Whitney E. Understanding Normal and Clinical Nutrition. 10th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2015. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine the number of carbohydrate servings in 48 grapes, we need to know the typical carbohydrate content in a serving of grapes.

According to the USDA, a serving of grapes is about 1 cup, which is equivalent to around 32 grapes. One serving of grapes contains approximately 15 grams of carbohydrates.

Given:
- 1 serving of grapes = 32 grapes
- 1 serving of grapes = 15 grams of carbohydrates
- We have 48 grapes

Step 1: Calculate the number of servings in 48 grapes.
Number of servings = 48 grapes ÷ 32 grapes per serving
Number of servings = 1.5 servings

Step 2: Calculate the total carbohydrate content in 48 grapes.
Total carbohydrates = 1.5 servings × 15 grams of carbohydrates per serving
Total carbohydrates = 22.5 grams

Therefore, 48 grapes contain approximately 1.5 carbohydrate servings, which is closest to option B. 2 carbohydrate servings.

135. Which is the best tool for the community nutritionist to use to learn what locally grown foods residents consume most frequently?
A. Health Risk Appraisal B. Screening C. Focus Group D. Survey 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: All options listed are methods for obtaining data. A health risk appraisal characterizes a population's general health, screening represents a preventive health activity, and, although a focus group would be plausible, it is a very expensive way of obtaining both qualitative and quantitative information. Surveys are the least expensive systematic study of a cross-section of individuals.

References: Boyle MA, Holben DH. Community Nutrition in Action:: An Entrepreneurial Approach. 6th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The best tool for a community nutritionist to use to learn about the locally grown foods that residents consume most frequently is:

D. Survey

A survey is a research method that involves collecting data from a predefined group of respondents to gain information and insights on various topics of interest. Surveys can be conducted in various ways, such as online, phone, or in-person.

Here's why a survey is the most appropriate choice:

1. Reach: Surveys allow the nutritionist to gather information from a large number of residents, providing a more representative sample of the community.

2. Specific questions: Surveys can include specific questions about locally grown foods and consumption frequency, enabling the nutritionist to gather targeted information.

3. Quantifiable data: Surveys provide quantifiable data that can be easily analyzed and used to make informed decisions about community nutrition programs.

The other options are less suitable for this purpose:

A. Health Risk Appraisal: This tool assesses an individual's health risks based on lifestyle, family history, and other factors. It does not specifically address local food consumption.

B. Screening: Screening tests are used to detect potential health disorders or diseases in people who do not have any symptoms of disease. This is not relevant to assessing local food consumption.

C. Focus Group: While focus groups can provide valuable qualitative insights, they involve a smaller number of participants and may not be as representative of the entire community as a survey.

157. Which of the following is characteristic of stage 1 iron deficiency?
A. Iron-deficiency anemia B. Minor depletion of iron stores C. Severe depletion of iron stores D. Moderate depletion of iron stores 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The stages of iron deficiency are as follows: Stage 1: Moderate depletion of iron stores, no dysfunction; Stage 2: Severe depletion of iron stores, no dysfunction; Stage 3: Iron deficiency, dysfunction; Stage 4: Iron deficiency, dysfunction and anemia

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 658. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Stage 1 iron deficiency is characterized by minor depletion of iron stores (choice B).

Iron deficiency progresses through several stages:

1. Stage 1 (Iron Depletion): This stage is characterized by a reduction in iron stores, primarily in the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Serum ferritin levels decrease. However, hemoglobin levels remain normal, and there are no clinical symptoms of anemia.

2. Stage 2 (Iron-Deficient Erythropoiesis): If iron depletion continues, the body's iron supply becomes insufficient to support normal red blood cell production. This stage is characterized by reduced transferrin saturation, increased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and elevated transferrin receptor levels. Hemoglobin levels may still remain within the normal range.

3. Stage 3 (Iron-Deficiency Anemia): In this stage, hemoglobin production falls due to insufficient iron supply, leading to anemia. Red blood cells become microcytic (smaller than normal) and hypochromic (paler than normal). Symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, may appear.

Therefore, minor depletion of iron stores (choice B) is the correct answer for stage 1 iron deficiency. The other choices correspond to later stages or consequences of iron deficiency.

177. A patient in residential care receives a parenteral formula of D40W of 500 ml in one day. The number of kilocalories delivered is
A. 560 kcal B. 680 kcal C. 800 kcal D. 920 kcal 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The kilocalories delivered by dextrose in solution is 3.4 kcal/g—not the typical 4 kcal/g—so the correct answer is 680 kcal. In 1 L of D40W, there is 400 g dextrose, but the patient is only receiving 500 ml; thus, 200 g dextrose x 3.4 kcal/g = 680 kcal.

References: McClave SA, Taylor B, Martindale RG, et al. Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Adult Critically Ill Patient. JPEN J Paren Enteral Nutr. 2016;40(2)::159-211. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine the number of kilocalories delivered to the patient, we need to understand what D40W means and how to calculate the kilocalories from the given information.

Given:
- The patient receives a parenteral formula of D40W.
- The volume of the formula is 500 ml per day.

Step 1: Understand what D40W means.
D40W stands for Dextrose 40% in Water. This means that the solution contains 40 grams of dextrose (glucose) per 100 ml of water.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of dextrose in the 500 ml solution.
Amount of dextrose = Concentration × Volume
Amount of dextrose = 40 g/100 ml × 500 ml = 200 g

Step 3: Convert grams of dextrose to kilocalories.
1 gram of dextrose (carbohydrate) provides 4 kilocalories (kcal).
Kilocalories from dextrose = Amount of dextrose × 4 kcal/g
Kilocalories from dextrose = 200 g × 4 kcal/g = 800 kcal

Therefore, the patient receives 800 kcal (option C) from the parenteral formula of D40W in one day.

188. When considering cow's milk versus breastmilk, which of the following is true?
A. Breastmilk provides less energy from protein. B. Breastmilk provides more calcium. C. Cow's milk provides less potassium and sodium. D. Cow's milk contains a lower proportion of casein compared to whey protein. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Breastmilk provides approximately 6% of energy from protein, whereas cow's milk provides 20% of energy from protein. Breastmilk also has less calcium, sodium, and potassium than cow’s milk. Casein accounts for 80% of the protein in cow’s milk, so it actually has a higher proportion of casein compared to whey protein.

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 315. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Cow's milk provides less potassium and sodium compared to breastmilk.

Let's analyze each option:

A. Breastmilk provides less energy from protein.
This is incorrect. Breastmilk has a higher proportion of energy from protein compared to cow's milk.

B. Breastmilk provides more calcium.
This is incorrect. Cow's milk contains more calcium than breastmilk.

C. Cow's milk provides less potassium and sodium.
This is correct. Breastmilk contains higher levels of potassium and sodium compared to cow's milk, which is important for the growth and development of infants.

D. Cow's milk contains a lower proportion of casein compared to whey protein.
This is incorrect. Cow's milk has a higher proportion of casein compared to whey protein, while breastmilk has a higher proportion of whey protein compared to casein.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Cow's milk provides less potassium and sodium compared to breastmilk.

192. What is the Institute of Medicine's recommended rate of weight gain per week during the second and third trimesters for pregnant people whose body mass index (BMI) is greater than 30?
A. 0.5 pounds B. 0.6 pounds C. 0.7 pounds D. 0.8 pounds 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The Institute of Medicine's recommended rate of weight gain per week during the second and third trimesters for pregnant people whose BMI is greater than 30 is 0.5 pounds.

References: Institute of Medicine. Weight Gain During Pregnancy:: Reexamining the Guidelines. Washington, DC:: National Academies Press; 2009. Consensus Report Brief. Accessed February 2, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) provides guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy based on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). For women with a pre-pregnancy BMI greater than 30, which falls into the obese category, the recommended rate of weight gain per week during the second and third trimesters is approximately 0.5 pounds (or about 0.23 kg).

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 0.5 pounds.

Here's a breakdown of the IOM's recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy:

- Underweight (BMI < 18.5): 1.0-1.3 pounds per week
- Normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9): 0.8-1.0 pounds per week
- Overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9): 0.5-0.7 pounds per week
- Obese (BMI ≥ 30): 0.4-0.6 pounds per week

211. Which is an example of chemical contamination?
A. Acidic action of foods with metal-lined containers B. Metal curls from a worn-out can opener that fell into the food when the can is being opened C. Development of an off-flavor due to uncontrolled enzyme reaction D. Anisakis contamination from fish 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Chemical contamination occurs in preserved foods, especially high-acid canned foods like fruit juice, sauerkraut, tomatoes, and lemonade, that are stored in metal-lined containers. Chemical contamination is usually the result of interaction between the contents and an imperfect container. There may be gas produced or discoloration of the tin and can result in metal poisonings.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Metal curls from a worn-out can opener that fell into the food when the can is being opened.

Chemical contamination refers to the presence of harmful chemicals in food, which can occur during various stages of food production, processing, storage, or preparation. In this case, metal curls from a worn-out can opener falling into the food represent a type of chemical contamination, as the metal particles can react with the food and potentially cause harm to the consumer.

The other options are not examples of chemical contamination:

A. Acidic action of foods with metal-lined containers is an example of a chemical reaction between food and the container, but it is not necessarily a contamination unless harmful substances leach into the food.

C. Development of an off-flavor due to uncontrolled enzyme reaction is a biochemical process that affects the taste and quality of the food but does not involve the introduction of harmful chemicals.

D. Anisakis contamination from fish is an example of biological contamination, as Anisakis is a parasitic nematode that can infect fish and cause illness in humans if consumed.

216. What type of jewelry are workers in food preparation permitted to wear?
A. Plain wedding band B. Medical alert bracelet C. Bracelets without snaps or clasps D. None 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: During food preparation, the only jewelry allowed on arms and hands is a plain ring, such as a wedding band. Bracelets, including medical information jewelry, and elaborate rings are prohibited.

References: US Department of Health and Human Services. FDA Food Code. 2017. Accessed April 23, 2020. Available at:: Website 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. None.

According to food safety regulations, workers in food preparation areas are generally not permitted to wear any jewelry on their hands or arms, with the exception of a plain wedding band and medical alert bracelets or necklaces. This rule is in place to minimize the risk of physical contamination of food by jewelry and to ensure proper handwashing.

Here's a breakdown of the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

A. Plain wedding band: While a plain wedding band is sometimes allowed, it is not always permitted in food preparation areas.

B. Medical alert bracelet: Medical alert bracelets are usually an exception to the no-jewelry rule, as they serve an important purpose for the wearer's health and safety. However, they are not the only type of jewelry permitted.

C. Bracelets without snaps or clasps: Regardless of the type of clasp or lack thereof, bracelets are generally not allowed in food preparation areas as they can still pose a risk of physical contamination and may interfere with proper handwashing.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. None, as it is the safest and most comprehensive policy for jewelry in food preparation areas.

A. Steamed haddock, rice, roasted cauliflower, vanilla frozen yogurt with fresh pineapple B. Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries C. Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet D. Meatballs, tiny whole potatoes, brussels sprouts, fresh bing cherries 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The meal in option "B" (baked pork chop, sauteed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries) shows the best use of color in a lunch meal, as well as a variety of flavors, textures, consistency, and food shapes that are balanced. The meal is very colorful and the foods complement each other and employ a variety of cooking methods. The meals in options "A" and "C" are mostly white in color and not as visually appealing. The meal in option "D" has color but all the foods have the same shape (round).

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine which lunch menu reflects proper menu planning principles related to visual presentation, we need to consider factors such as color, texture, and variety. A well-presented meal should have a balance of colors, textures, and flavors.

A. Steamed haddock, rice, roasted cauliflower, vanilla frozen yogurt with fresh pineapple
This menu lacks color variety, as the haddock, rice, and cauliflower are all white or light-colored. However, the pineapple adds a pop of color to the dessert.

B. Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries
This menu has a good balance of colors, with the green broccoli, brown pork chop, and white rice. The strawberries add an attractive red color to the dessert.

C. Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet
While the chicken and mashed potatoes provide a neutral base, this menu lacks color variety. The parsnips and lemon sorbet are both light-colored and do not add much visual contrast.

D. Meatballs, tiny whole potatoes, brussels sprouts, fresh bing cherries
This menu offers a good variety of colors and textures. The meatballs provide a brown color, the potatoes add a starchy texture, and the green brussels sprouts contribute color and a different texture. The bing cherries add a vibrant red color to the meal.

Based on the analysis of color, texture, and variety, the lunch menu that best reflects proper menu planning principles related to visual presentation is option B: Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries.

225. A recipe requires 1 3/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca. Tapioca is purchased in twelve 8-oz boxes in a case and costs $41.88 per case. Three cups of quick-cooking tapioca weighs 1 lb. What is the recipe cost for tapioca?
A. $2.33 B. $4.07 C. $5.24 D. $6.98 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: One case of tapioca contains twelve 8-oz boxes for a total of 6 lb (12 boxes * 7 0.5 lb = 6 lb). To calculate the price per pound:
$41.88 (total cost of case) ÷ 6 lb = $6.98 per pound
To calculate the price per cup, remember that 3 cups of tapioca weighs 1 lb:
$6.98 ÷ 3 cups = $2.33
To calculate the price per 1¾ cups (recipe cost): $2.33 × 1.75 = $4.07

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The recipe requires 1 3/4 cup of quick-cooking tapioca.
   * Tapioca is purchased in cases, each containing twelve 8-oz boxes.
   * Each case costs $41.88.
   * 3 cups of quick-cooking tapioca weighs 1 lb.

2. Find the total weight of tapioca in one case:
   * 1 box = 8 oz
   * 1 case = 12 boxes
   * Weight of tapioca in one case = 12 × 8 oz = 96 oz = 6 lbs

3. Find the cost of tapioca per pound:
   * Cost per case = $41.88
   * Weight of tapioca per case = 6 lbs
   * Cost per pound = $41.88 ÷ 6 = $6.98 per lb

4. Find the weight of tapioca required for the recipe:
   * 3 cups of tapioca = 1 lb
   * 1 cup of tapioca = 1/3 lb
   * 1 3/4 cup of tapioca = 1 3/4 × 1/3 lb = 7/12 lb

5. Calculate the cost of tapioca for the recipe:
   * Cost per pound = $6.98
   * Weight of tapioca required = 7/12 lb
   * Cost of tapioca for the recipe = $6.98 × 7/12 = $4.07

Therefore, the correct answer is B. $4.07.

258. Using the following figures, calculate the break-even point for a café: Fixed costs = $52,000; variable costs = $85,000; total sales = $210,000.
A. $86,666.66 B. $113,333.33 C. $130,000.00 D. $473,000.00 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Break-even point in sales = Fixed costs/Contribution margin ratio

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To calculate the break-even point, we need to use the following formula:

Break-even point = Fixed costs ÷ (1 - (Variable costs ÷ Total sales))

Let's plug in the given values:

Fixed costs = $52,000
Variable costs = $85,000
Total sales = $210,000

Break-even point = $52,000 ÷ (1 - ($85,000 ÷ $210,000))

First, let's calculate the variable costs as a percentage of total sales:
$85,000 ÷ $210,000 = 0.4047619 (rounded to 7 decimal places)

Now, let's plug this value into the formula:
Break-even point = $52,000 ÷ (1 - 0.4047619)
Break-even point = $52,000 ÷ 0.5952381
Break-even point = $87,368.42 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

The closest answer among the given options is A. $86,666.66.

259. On Thursday, the kitchen produced a total of 386 meals. That day, staff worked a combined total of 58 hours. What were the labor minutes per meal for that day?
A. 0.15 B. 6.66 C. 9.02 D. 15.02 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: First convert the hours to minutes: 58 x 60 = 3,480 minutes. Then divide minutes by total number of meals to calculate the labor minutes per meal. 3,480/386 = 9.02 minutes per meal.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Okay, let's organize the information we have:
* The kitchen produced 386 meals on Thursday.
* The staff worked a combined total of 58 hours that day.

We need to find the labor minutes per meal. To do this, we need to:
1. Convert the total staff hours into minutes.
2. Divide the total staff minutes by the number of meals produced.

Step 1: Convert hours to minutes
* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* 58 hours = 58 × 60 = 3,480 minutes

Step 2: Calculate labor minutes per meal
* Labor minutes per meal = Total staff minutes ÷ Number of meals produced
* Labor minutes per meal = 3,480 ÷ 386
* Labor minutes per meal ≈ 9.02

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 9.02 labor minutes per meal.

270. In which step in the HACCP plan can hazards that can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to safe levels be identified?
A. Conduct a hazard analysis B. Determine critical control points C. Establish critical limits D. Identify corrective actions 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Critical control points (CCP) are determined to prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to safe levels. Depending on the process, there may be more than one CCP. A CCP can be purchasing, receiving, storing, preparing, cooking, or serving and depends on the product.

References: National Restaurant Association Education Foundation. ServSafe Coursebook. 6th ed. Chicago:: NRA; 2012::10-6. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. Conduct a hazard analysis.

In the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) system, the step in which hazards that can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to safe levels are identified is the hazard analysis step.

The hazard analysis is the first principle of the HACCP system. It involves identifying potential hazards associated with a food product at all stages of its production, from raw materials to consumption. The hazards can be biological, chemical, or physical.

The other steps mentioned:

B. Determine critical control points: This step identifies the points in the process where control measures can be applied to prevent, eliminate, or reduce the identified hazards to acceptable levels.

C. Establish critical limits: This step sets the maximum and minimum values for each critical control point to ensure that the hazards are controlled.

D. Identify corrective actions: This step establishes the actions to be taken when a critical limit is not met to ensure that the process is brought back under control and the affected products are handled appropriately.

While these steps are essential in the HACCP system, the identification of hazards that can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to safe levels is specifically done in the hazard analysis step.

273. What inventory valuation method assumes that newer items are used before older items?
A. FIFO B. LIFO C. Latest purchase price D. Weighted average 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: LIFO (last in, first out) is based on the assumption that newer items are used before older items, in other words, that current purchases are largely meeting current production needs. FIFO (first in, first out) is based on using older items before newer items.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The inventory valuation method that assumes newer items are used before older items is:

A. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)

FIFO assumes that the oldest inventory items (the first ones purchased or produced) are sold or used first, while the newer items remain in inventory. This method is based on the assumption that a company typically sells or uses its oldest inventory first to minimize the risk of obsolescence or spoilage.

The other methods mentioned:

B. LIFO (Last-In, First-Out): This method assumes that the most recently purchased or produced items are sold or used first, while the older items remain in inventory.

C. Latest purchase price: This is not a standard inventory valuation method. Inventory valuation methods typically consider the cost of items rather than their purchase price.

D. Weighted average: This method calculates the average cost of all items in inventory, considering the varying costs and quantities of each item purchased or produced.

275. Which of the following is the best example of a question to be solved by regression analysis?
A. What is the staff procedure for using hazardous cleaning materials? B. When are employees most likely to take vacation days? C. How long should employee probation last? D. Why was there a sales slump in July? 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Companies often use regression analysis to understand and explain a phenomenon, predict what will happen in the future, or make a decision on an action to take. A regression analysis may help a company understand and explain why sales slumped in a specific time period.

References: Gallo A. A refresher on regression analysis. Harvard Business Review. November 2015. Accessed April 5, 2020. Available at:: Website 

Claude 3 Response: 

The best example of a question that can be solved by regression analysis is:

B. When are employees most likely to take vacation days?

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

In this case, the question "When are employees most likely to take vacation days?" can be addressed using regression analysis. The dependent variable would be the number of vacation days taken by employees, while the independent variables could include factors such as the month, season, employee seniority, or any other relevant factors that might influence vacation patterns.

By analyzing historical data on employee vacation days and the associated independent variables, a regression model can be built to identify patterns and predict when employees are most likely to take their vacation days.

The other options given are not suitable for regression analysis because:

A. "What is the staff procedure for using hazardous cleaning materials?" is a question about a specific procedure and does not involve analyzing relationships between variables.

C. "How long should employee probation last?" is a policy decision and does not require regression analysis.

D. "Why was there a sales slump in July?" is an investigative question that may require various data analysis techniques, but regression analysis alone may not provide a complete answer.

291. According to the Food Code, a consumer advisory must be posted or available at a self-service unit where raw or partially cooked food is held for service and readily accessible. What is the exception to this requirement?
A. Catered events B. Salad bars C. Sushi bars D. Self-selection display cases 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The food code requires that buffets, salad bars, sushi bars, and display cases post a consumer advisory when raw or partially cooked food is held for service and readily accessible to consumers before they select their foods. However, in a catered situation like a wedding reception, guests are responsible for making their own requests or selections.

References: US Public Health Service. FDA Food Code. 2017. Accessed May 7, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Sushi bars.

According to the FDA Food Code, a consumer advisory is required for any ready-to-eat foods that contain raw or partially cooked ingredients, such as raw fish or undercooked eggs. This advisory informs consumers about the increased risk of foodborne illness associated with consuming these foods.

However, sushi bars are an exception to this requirement. The Food Code states that a consumer advisory is not required for sushi bars because it is generally understood by consumers that sushi may contain raw or undercooked ingredients.

The other options are not exceptions to the consumer advisory requirement:

A. Catered events: If raw or partially cooked foods are served at catered events, a consumer advisory must be provided.

B. Salad bars: If a salad bar contains items with raw or partially cooked ingredients, such as Caesar dressing made with raw eggs, a consumer advisory is necessary.

D. Self-selection display cases: If raw or partially cooked foods are available in self-selection display cases, a consumer advisory must be posted or readily available.
--------------------


292. What product is more likely to be sold using a LIFO inventory approach?
A. Salmon portions B. Brick of cheddar C. Deli meat cuts D. Jar of spaghetti sauce 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The LIFO, or last-in/first-out, inventory approach is not practical for perishable goods of using newest inventory first. LIFO is better suited for nonperishable products, as perishable food could spoil while sitting idle in inventory, thereby leading to losses.

References: Tardi C. Inventory valuation:: LIFO vs FIFO. Investopedia. Updated April 2020. Accessed November 23, 2020. Available at:: Website 

Claude 3 Response: 

The product most likely to be sold using a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) inventory approach is:

C. Deli meat cuts

Explanation:
LIFO is an inventory management method where the most recently produced or acquired items are sold first. This approach is most suitable for perishable goods with a short shelf life, as it ensures that the oldest stock is kept in inventory while the newest stock is sold first.

Among the given options, deli meat cuts have the shortest shelf life and are highly perishable. Selling the most recently sliced or packaged deli meats first helps minimize spoilage and waste.

The other options are less likely to use LIFO:

A. Salmon portions: While perishable, they can be frozen and have a longer shelf life than deli meats.
B. Brick of cheddar: Cheese has a relatively long shelf life and can be aged, making LIFO less suitable.
D. Jar of spaghetti sauce: Sealed, shelf-stable products like spaghetti sauce have a long shelf life and are more likely to use FIFO (First-In, First-Out) inventory management.

299. One pound of turkey as purchased yields .35 lb cooked turkey without skin. The cost of the turkey breast is $1.19 per pound. What is the cost of a 4-ounce serving?
A. $0.85 B. $0.42 C. $0.36 D. $8.50 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Formula: AP price/EP yield = EP price

References: Lynch FT. The Book of Yields. 8th ed. Hoboken, NJ:: Wiley; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * 1 pound of turkey as purchased yields 0.35 pound of cooked turkey without skin.
   * The cost of the turkey breast is $1.19 per pound.
   * We need to find the cost of a 4-ounce serving.

2. Convert 4 ounces to pounds:
   * 1 pound = 16 ounces
   * 4 ounces = 4 ÷ 16 = 0.25 pound

3. Calculate the amount of purchased turkey needed to get a 4-ounce (0.25 pound) serving:
   * 1 pound of purchased turkey yields 0.35 pound of cooked turkey
   * To get 0.25 pound of cooked turkey, we need: 0.25 ÷ 0.35 ≈ 0.714 pound of purchased turkey

4. Calculate the cost of 0.714 pound of purchased turkey:
   * The cost of turkey breast is $1.19 per pound
   * Cost of 0.714 pound = 0.714 × $1.19 ≈ $0.85

Therefore, the cost of a 4-ounce serving of cooked turkey without skin is approximately $0.85. The correct answer is A.

300. A whole, bone-in ham weighs 18 lbs as purchased (AP) has an edible portion yield (EP) of 56%. Each ham costs $32.94. What is the invoice cost to serve 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham?
A. $155.55 B. $223.99 C. $277.78 D. $296.46 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: To get the edible portion yield per ham, multiply 18 lbs AP x 56% EP yield =10.08 lbs edible portion per ham. You need 85 lbs cooked sliced ham, so you would divide this amount by the edible portion per ham: 85 lbs ÷ 10.08 lbs = 8.43 hams. Thus, 9 hams are needed. Multiply the cost of the ham $32.94 x 9 hams = $296.46

References: Molt M, Shugart G. Food for Fifty. 13th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson Prentice Hall; 2011::190. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Okay, let's organize the information we have:
* The whole, bone-in ham weighs 18 lbs as purchased (AP).
* The edible portion yield (EP) is 56%.
* Each ham costs $32.94.
* We need to serve 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the edible portion (EP) weight of one ham:
   * EP weight = AP weight × EP percentage
   * EP weight = 18 lbs × 0.56 = 10.08 lbs

2. Calculate the number of hams needed to serve 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham:
   * Number of hams = 85 lbs ÷ 10.08 lbs per ham
   * Number of hams = 8.43 (rounded up to 9 hams, as we can't buy a fraction of a ham)

3. Calculate the total cost of the hams:
   * Total cost = Number of hams × Cost per ham
   * Total cost = 9 × $32.94 = $296.46

Therefore, the invoice cost to serve 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham is $296.46 (option D).

303. Which of the following is an example of conceptual decision-making style?
A. The manager solicits suggestions from the team about meal options to eventually promote B. The manager evaluates past experiences to determine meal options that would be successfully promoted C. The manager reviews past sales data to identify which meal options are ideal for promotions D. The manager convenes a committee that will decide by consensus which meal options to promote 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Four common decision-making styles are conceptual (leader seeks ideas from team members), directive (leader uses past experience to arrive at a decision without outside input), analytical (leader uses facts, data, and observation to make a decision), and behavioral (leader collaborates with others, whose feelings and opinions are given equal weight). Conceptual decision-making is effective in long-term projects.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management Principles and Practice. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice Hall; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The conceptual decision-making style involves considering abstract ideas, exploring possibilities, and thinking creatively to make decisions. Among the given options, the one that best exemplifies the conceptual decision-making style is:

A. The manager solicits suggestions from the team about meal options to eventually promote

In this scenario, the manager is gathering ideas and suggestions from the team, which aligns with the conceptual decision-making style. By involving the team and considering their input, the manager is exploring various possibilities and encouraging creative thinking to determine the meal options for promotion.

The other options represent different decision-making styles:

B. The manager evaluates past experiences to determine meal options that would be successfully promoted - This aligns more with an experiential decision-making style, where the manager relies on their own past experiences to make decisions.

C. The manager reviews past sales data to identify which meal options are ideal for promotions - This represents an analytical decision-making style, where the manager uses data and analysis to make decisions.

D. The manager convenes a committee that will decide by consensus which meal options to promote - This is an example of a participative or collaborative decision-making style, where a group makes decisions together through consensus.

311. What entity conducts hospital accreditation surveys annually?
A. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services B. The Joint Commission  C. DNV D. US Department of Health and Human Services 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: DNV conducts hospital accreditation surveys annually, though they are only reported to CMN every 3 years. The Joint Commission conducts accreditation surveys every 3 years. CMS and HHS do not perform accreditation surveys.

References: DNV. NIAHO Hospital Accreditation. Accessed January 11, 2022. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

B. The Joint Commission

The Joint Commission (TJC), formerly known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), is the primary entity responsible for conducting annual hospital accreditation surveys in the United States. 

The Joint Commission is an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies healthcare organizations and programs in the United States. Its accreditation is recognized as a symbol of quality and reflects an organization's commitment to meeting specific performance standards.

While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) play important roles in healthcare regulation and oversight, they do not directly conduct annual hospital accreditation surveys. DNV, or Det Norske Veritas, is another organization that provides accreditation services for hospitals, but it is not as widely recognized as The Joint Commission in the United States.

A. Needs of seller B. Future growth C. Planning for today D. Sales volume 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Successful marketing focuses on producing goods that customers want, forecasting future growth, and being profit oriented. On the other hand, selling stresses the needs of the seller, focuses on the product, is sales-volume-oriented, and plans for today.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The term that is most closely related to marketing among the given options is:

D. Sales volume

Explanation:
Sales volume refers to the total number or quantity of products or services sold by a company over a specific period of time. It is a key metric used in marketing to measure the effectiveness of marketing strategies, promotions, and overall business performance.

The other options are not as directly related to marketing:

A. Needs of seller: While understanding the needs of the seller is important for business strategy, it is not a specific marketing term.

B. Future growth: Although marketing strategies can contribute to future growth, the term itself is more related to business planning and strategy.

C. Planning for today: This term is not specifically related to marketing and could apply to various aspects of business operations.

313. What is the Food Code ruling for use of tobacco by foodservice employees?
A. Employees are not permitted to use tobacco on premises B. Employees may use tobacco in designated areas C. Any use of tobacco is grounds for immediate dismissal D. Continued employment is contingent on eventual participation in a smoking cessation program 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: According to the Food Code, employees are permitted to eat, drink, or use any form of tobacco only in designated areas where there will be no potential contamination of exposed food; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; unwrapped single-service and single-use articles; or other items needing protection..

References: US Department of Health and Human Services. FDA Food Code 2017. Accessed April 23, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Employees may use tobacco in designated areas.

According to the FDA Food Code, employees are allowed to use tobacco, but only in designated areas. Specifically, the Food Code states:

"Employees shall eat, drink, or use any form of tobacco only in designated areas where the contamination of exposed FOOD; clean EQUIPMENT, UTENSILS, and LINENS; unwrapped SINGLE-SERVICE and SINGLE-USE ARTICLES; or other items needing protection can not result."

The other options are incorrect:

A. Employees are permitted to use tobacco on premises, but only in designated areas.
C. Using tobacco is not grounds for immediate dismissal, as long as it is used in designated areas.
D. Continued employment is not contingent on participation in a smoking cessation program.

The key point is that tobacco use is allowed for foodservice employees, but it must be restricted to specific designated areas to prevent contamination of food, equipment, and other sensitive items.

324. Among the following, which is the most important plan an onsite foodservice manager should have in place for emergency preparedness?
A. Menu plan B. Staffing plan C. Equipment plan D. Inventory plan 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The menu plan is the key for emergency preparedness. Menu plans vary depending on the type of emergency. Staffing, equipment, and inventory plans are important, but they all revolve around the menu planned for an emergency.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2016; 60. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The most important plan an onsite foodservice manager should have in place for emergency preparedness is B. Staffing plan.

Here's why:

1. Safety: In an emergency, the safety of the staff and customers is the top priority. A well-prepared staffing plan ensures that there are enough trained personnel to handle the situation effectively and safely.

2. Continuity of service: A solid staffing plan helps maintain continuity of service during an emergency. It ensures that critical roles are filled and that the foodservice operation can continue to function, even if some staff members are unable to work.

3. Adaptability: A staffing plan allows the manager to adapt to the situation by allocating resources and assigning roles based on the specific needs of the emergency.

4. Coordination: An effective staffing plan enables better coordination among team members during an emergency, as everyone is aware of their roles and responsibilities.

While menu, equipment, and inventory plans are also important for emergency preparedness, they are secondary to ensuring that there is a sufficient number of trained staff members available to handle the situation. A well-prepared staffing plan is the foundation for executing other emergency plans effectively.

354. The evaluation tool that is used for effective planning and controls functions of management is called:
A. PERT chart B. MIS processing C. HACCP D. strategic planning 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: MIS processing and HACCP are not tools associated with functions of management. Strategic planning is a management process of determining long-term goals and the best approach to accomplish them. It is used to inform policies and operational decisions. The program evaluation review technique, or PERT, chart is the evaluation tool for controlling management functions.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management Principles and Practice. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice Hall; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. HACCP.

HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points. It is a systematic preventive approach to food safety and pharmaceutical safety that identifies potential hazards in the production process and designs measurements to reduce these risks to a safe level. HACCP is used as an evaluation tool for effective planning and control functions of management, particularly in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. PERT chart (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) is a project management tool used to schedule, organize, and coordinate tasks within a project. It is not specifically used as an evaluation tool for planning and control functions of management.

B. MIS processing (Management Information System) refers to the processing of data into information that is useful for management decision-making. While it aids in planning and control, it is not the specific evaluation tool mentioned in the question.

D. Strategic planning is the process of defining an organization's strategy and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy. It is a high-level planning process but not the specific evaluation tool used for effective planning and control functions of management.

357. Efficiency is
A. completing tasks while reducing labor costs B. completing tasks per protocol C. completing only what the manager tells an employee to do D. completing work assignments quickly 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Efficiency is the ability to accomplish something with the least waste of time and effort. Completing tasks while reducing labor costs is a mark of efficiency. 

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2017.264 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. completing tasks while reducing labor costs.

Efficiency is a measure of how well resources, such as time, money, and labor, are utilized to achieve a desired outcome. In a business context, efficiency often refers to the ability to complete tasks or produce goods and services while minimizing costs, particularly labor costs.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. completing tasks per protocol - While following protocols can contribute to efficiency, it is not the primary definition of efficiency. Protocols may not always be the most efficient way to complete tasks.

C. completing only what the manager tells an employee to do - Simply following orders from a manager does not necessarily result in efficiency. Managers may not always assign tasks in the most efficient manner, and employees may have insights that could improve efficiency.

D. completing work assignments quickly - While completing tasks quickly can be a component of efficiency, it is not the sole defining factor. Efficiency also involves minimizing costs and using resources effectively, not just working quickly.

368. Systems thinking is the management approach for considering the entire organization when making decisions or allocating resources. Which is an example of systems thinking?
A. Select a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily B. Reschedule kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations C. Develop a policy for using online job sites to attract applicants D. Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Rescheduling kitchen staff to prepare food to meet customer expectations changes the kitchen and staff/resource entirely. Making a change to the produce delivery does not change the kitchen and a policy for using online job sites would affect the human resources department.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011:: 49. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment.

Systems thinking involves considering the entire organization and its broader impact when making decisions. By selecting cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment, the organization is considering the environmental impact of its operations, which extends beyond the immediate scope of the kitchen or restaurant.

Here's why the other options do not exemplify systems thinking:

A. Selecting a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily is a decision focused on a specific operational need and does not necessarily consider the entire organization or its broader impact.

B. Rescheduling kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations is a decision focused on a specific operational challenge and customer satisfaction, but it does not consider the entire organization or its broader impact.

C. Developing a policy for using online job sites to attract applicants is a decision focused on a specific human resources process and does not necessarily consider the entire organization or its broader impact.

374. What word best describes taking something, planned and knowingly, without force, permission, or right?
A. Theft B. Pilfering C. Robbery D. Embezzlement 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Theft is premeditated without force, permission, or right. An example of pilfering is when an employee steals some lunch meat to take home. Robbery may involve force, and embezzling is most commonly taking money that belongs to the employer.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The word that best describes taking something, planned and knowingly, without force, permission, or right is:

B. Pilfering

Pilfering means stealing small amounts or petty theft, typically from an employer. It involves taking items knowingly and intentionally without permission, but without the use of force, which distinguishes it from robbery.

Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

A. Theft: A broader term that encompasses various forms of stealing, including pilfering.

C. Robbery: Involves the use of force or threat of force to take something from someone.

D. Embezzlement: Typically involves the misappropriation of funds entrusted to someone, often in a professional setting.

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Determination of how changes will be made is part of the P component of PDSA and impact determination is considered a component of S.

References: Joint Commission Resources. Cost-Effective Performance Improvement in Hospitals. Oakbrook Terrace, IL:: JCAHO; 2005::94. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Determine the impact of the intervention.

The PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) performance improvement model is a four-step iterative process used for continuous quality improvement in various fields, including healthcare. Here's a brief explanation of each component:

1. Plan: Identify the problem, analyze the root causes, and develop a plan for improvement.

2. Do: Implement the planned intervention or changes on a small scale.

3. Study: Collect and analyze data to determine the impact of the intervention and whether it led to the desired improvements.

4. Act: Based on the results from the "Study" phase, decide whether to adopt, adapt, or abandon the intervention. If the intervention is successful, consider implementing it on a larger scale.

In this context, the "D" component of the PDSA model is often referred to as the "Do" phase, which involves implementing the planned intervention. However, among the given options, C. Determine the impact of the intervention best describes the "Study" phase of the PDSA model, not the "Do" phase.
--------------------


378. Which statement best describes the “A” component of the PDSA performance improvement model?
A. Determine how changes will be implemented B. Implement the intervention C. Determine the impact of the intervention D. Maintain and continue improvement 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Maintaining and continuing improvement is included in the A component of the PDSA model. Determination of how changes will be implemented is part of P, implementation of the plan is included in D, and determination of the impact of the plan is included in S.

References: Joint Commission Resources. Cost-Effective Performance Improvement in Hospitals. Oakbrook Terrace, IL:: JCAHO; 2005::94. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Determine the impact of the intervention.

The PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) performance improvement model is a four-step iterative process used for continuous quality improvement in various fields, including healthcare. Here's a brief explanation of each component:

1. Plan: Identify the problem, gather data, and develop a plan for improvement.
2. Do: Implement the plan on a small scale or as a pilot project.
3. Study: Analyze the results of the intervention and determine its impact.
4. Act: If the intervention is successful, implement it on a larger scale. If not, make adjustments and repeat the PDSA cycle.

In this context, the "Study" component of the PDSA model involves determining the impact of the intervention by analyzing the data collected during the "Do" phase. This step helps in assessing whether the implemented changes have led to the desired improvements or if further adjustments are needed.

379. Which of the following is least likely to be documented?
A. Employee receiving advice on what to communicate to a contractor in an email B. Employee wearing leggings in violation of dress code C. Employee indicating lack of availability for full-time shifts D. Employee spending hours in conversations unrelated to work 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Documentation of employee behavior includes conduct, performance, appearance, and work availability, which are a part of progressive discipline. Advice is often intended as a friendly offering and is not usually documented.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The option least likely to be documented is B. Employee wearing leggings in violation of dress code.

Here's the reasoning:

A. Employee receiving advice on what to communicate to a contractor in an email: This is likely to be documented because the advice given to the employee about communicating with a contractor may be important for record-keeping, especially if it relates to contractual obligations or project requirements.

B. Employee wearing leggings in violation of dress code: Dress code violations are often addressed verbally and may not be formally documented unless they are recurring or part of a larger pattern of misconduct. Minor, one-time dress code infractions are less likely to be recorded compared to the other options.

C. Employee indicating lack of availability for full-time shifts: Changes in an employee's availability or shift preferences are usually documented for scheduling and staffing purposes. This information helps managers plan and ensures clear communication about the employee's work hours.

D. Employee spending hours in conversations unrelated to work: Excessive time spent on non-work-related conversations could be documented as part of a performance review or disciplinary action, especially if it affects productivity or violates company policies.

In summary, while all of these situations could potentially be documented, a minor dress code violation is the least likely to be formally recorded compared to communication advice, shift availability changes, and excessive non-work-related conversations.

392. A manager overlooks older adults for fast-paced supervisory roles without evaluating their qualifications based on an assumption that their age prevents them from being effective. What is this manager demonstrating?
A. Discrimination B. Stereotyping C. Inclusion D. Exclusion 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A manager who makes hiring decisions based on a belief about the abilities of a class of people rather than individual characteristics is demonstrating discrimination.

References: Lund A, Latortue KY, Rodriguez J. Dietetic training:: Understanding racial inequity in power and privilege. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2021;121(8)::1437-1440. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Stereotyping.

Explanation:
Stereotyping is a cognitive bias where an oversimplified, generalized belief is applied to a particular group of people. In this case, the manager is making an assumption about older adults' capabilities based on their age, without considering their individual qualifications or abilities. This is a clear example of age-based stereotyping.

While the manager's actions could lead to discrimination (answer A), the core issue here is the stereotypical assumption about older adults' capabilities. Discrimination would be the resulting action based on this stereotype.

Inclusion (answer C) and exclusion (answer D) are not directly relevant to the scenario presented. The manager's actions are not promoting inclusion or deliberately excluding older adults; rather, the decision is based on a stereotypical belief.
--------------------


394. Which tenet of behavioral learning theory makes it potentially inappropriate to apply this model in a foodservice environment?
A. Use positive reinforcement B. Provide a good role model C. Require that learners be permitted to ask questions D. Ignore undesirable behaviors 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In behavioral learning theory, conditioning is used to learn new information and behaviors. Conditioning is a process by which one learns and that process can be less effective in a chaotic environment. Chaotic environments can wrongly give the impression that multiple, inconsistent behaviors are acceptable, resulting in confusion about what is considered the acceptable behavior.

References: Holli BB, Williams AB. Communication & Education Skills for Dietetics Professionals. 5th ed. Baltimore, MD:: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins; 2008. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The tenet of behavioral learning theory that makes it potentially inappropriate to apply this model in a foodservice environment is:

D. Ignore undesirable behaviors

Explanation:
In a foodservice environment, ignoring undesirable behaviors could lead to serious consequences related to food safety, hygiene, and customer satisfaction. Behavioral learning theory suggests that ignoring undesirable behaviors will eventually lead to their extinction. However, in a foodservice setting, it is crucial to address and correct any inappropriate or unsafe practices immediately to maintain standards and prevent potential health hazards.

The other tenets mentioned are generally appropriate in a foodservice environment:

A. Use positive reinforcement: Encouraging and rewarding good practices can help reinforce desired behaviors and maintain a positive work environment.

B. Provide a good role model: Demonstrating proper techniques, hygiene, and customer service can set a positive example for employees to follow.

C. Require that learners be permitted to ask questions: Encouraging open communication and allowing employees to ask questions can help clarify any doubts, improve understanding, and ensure that proper procedures are followed.

Therefore, while most tenets of behavioral learning theory can be applied effectively in a foodservice environment, ignoring undesirable behaviors is not appropriate due to the potential risks involved.

401. Which term best describes overall space planning that includes defining the size, shape, style, and decoration?
A. Design B. Layout C. Blueprint D. Flow 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Design refers to the overall space planning; layout is the detailed arrangement of a building and its floor and/or counter space; and blueprint is what the architect will provide to the contractor so the space and its structures are built according to specifications. Flow is the movement of product or people through an operation. 

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The term that best describes overall space planning, including defining the size, shape, style, and decoration, is:

A. Design

Design is a comprehensive term that encompasses various aspects of planning and creating a space, including its layout, aesthetic appeal, and functionality. It involves making decisions about the size and shape of the space, the style and theme of the decor, and the overall flow and arrangement of elements within the space.

The other options have more specific meanings:

- Layout refers to the arrangement or plan of a space, focusing on the positioning of elements.
- Blueprint is a detailed technical drawing or plan of a building or structure.
- Flow describes the movement or circulation within a space, but it does not encompass all aspects of space planning.

Therefore, "Design" is the most appropriate term to describe the overall space planning process that includes size, shape, style, and decoration.

408. When preparing a PES statement in situations where there are diagnoses from multiple domains, which diagnosis domain should the dietetics professional prioritize?
A. Intake B. Physical conditions C. Knowledge D. Nutrition-focused physical findings 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When writing a PES statement and there is a choice between diagnoses from different domains, priority should be given to the intake-related nutrition diagnosis, as it is considered the one more specific to the role of the RDN.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. Communicating the Nutrition Diagnosis or Problem Statement:: PES. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at:: Website 

Claude 3 Response: 

When preparing a PES (Problem, Etiology, Signs/Symptoms) statement with diagnoses from multiple domains, the dietetics professional should prioritize the nutrition-focused physical findings (Option D).

Rationale:
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) recommends that nutrition-focused physical findings take precedence over other domains when formulating a PES statement. Nutrition-focused physical findings are direct observations or measurements made by the dietetics professional during the nutrition assessment, which provide the most relevant and objective data related to the patient's nutritional status.

The order of priority for the domains in a PES statement, according to the AND, is as follows:

1. Nutrition-focused physical findings
2. Biochemical data, medical tests, and procedures
3. Food/nutrition-related history
4. Anthropometric measurements
5. Client history

While intake (Option A), physical conditions (Option B), and knowledge (Option C) are essential components of a comprehensive nutrition assessment, they are not as directly related to the patient's nutritional status as nutrition-focused physical findings. Therefore, when multiple domains are involved, the dietetics professional should prioritize the nutrition-focused physical findings in the PES statement.
--------------------


412. The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Disaster Feeding Program are examples of food distribution programs. Which of the following statements best describes the similarities of the two programs?
A. Both programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and provide commodity foods to local food distribution and service agencies. B. Both programs serve older adults and provide commodity foods to local food distribution and service agencies C. Both programs serve low-income populations and supplemental food supplies are either distributed to individual households or as meals served in congregate dining centers. D. Both programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and food supplies are either distributed to individual households or as meals served in congregate dining centers. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Both of these programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and provide commodity foods that serve meals. The Emergency Food Assistance Program does not distribute to individual households.

References: The American Dietetic Association. The position of the American Dietetic Association:: child and adolescent nutrition assistance programs. J Am Diet Assoc. 2010;110::794-795. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine which statement best describes the similarities between The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Disaster Feeding Program, let's analyze each option:

A. Both programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and provide commodity foods to local food distribution and service agencies.
- This statement mentions that both programs serve various age groups and provide commodity foods to local agencies. However, it doesn't specify if these programs are targeted towards low-income populations or how the food is distributed.

B. Both programs serve older adults and provide commodity foods to local food distribution and service agencies.
- This statement is too narrow, as it only mentions older adults as the target population, while the question suggests that the programs serve a broader range of people.

C. Both programs serve low-income populations and supplemental food supplies are either distributed to individual households or as meals served in congregate dining centers.
- This statement correctly identifies that both programs serve low-income populations, which is a key similarity. It also specifies how the food is distributed, either directly to households or through congregate dining centers.

D. Both programs serve children, adolescents, and other age groups and food supplies are either distributed to individual households or as meals served in congregate dining centers.
- While this statement correctly mentions the distribution methods, it doesn't specify that the programs target low-income populations, which is a crucial aspect of their similarity.

Based on the analysis, the best answer is C. Both The Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Disaster Feeding Program serve low-income populations and distribute food either directly to households or through congregate dining centers.

415. Which of the following is an example of a violation of “beneficence” according to the Code of Ethics?
A. Failing to obtain state licensure B. Providing MNT to a dialysis patient despite having no training in renal dietetics C. Submitting a research paper that plagiarizes a textbook D. Sending an all-staff memo to accuse an employee of theft 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Beneficence represents the concept of professionalism. Within this category, the Code of Ethics requires that individuals “demonstrate respect, constructive dialogue, civility and professionalism in all communications, including social media.” Any suspicions of theft in the workplace should be addressed confidentially. In the Code of Ethics, state licensure and respecting intellectual property rights are related to autonomy, and practicing within professional limits is related to non-maleficence. 

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The Code of Ethics for the Nutrition and Dietetics Profession. Accessed January 21, 2022. Available at:: 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Providing Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) to a dialysis patient despite having no training in renal dietetics.

Explanation:
Beneficence is a principle in healthcare ethics that requires healthcare professionals to act in the best interest of their patients and to promote their well-being. Providing specialized medical treatment without proper training or expertise can potentially harm the patient, which goes against the principle of beneficence.

Let's examine the other options:

A. Failing to obtain state licensure: While this is unethical and illegal, it does not directly relate to the principle of beneficence.

C. Submitting a research paper that plagiarizes a textbook: This is an example of academic dishonesty and violates ethical principles related to integrity and honesty, but it does not directly violate beneficence.

D. Sending an all-staff memo to accuse an employee of theft: This action may be unprofessional and potentially violate principles of fairness and respect, but it does not directly relate to beneficence in the context of patient care.

Therefore, option B is the best example of a violation of beneficence according to the Code of Ethics for healthcare professionals.

423. Which of the following is involved in planning the nutrition intervention?
A. Defining the time and frequency of care B. Verifying the plan is being followed C. Modifying the plan of care D. Communicating the plan to the client 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Defining the time and frequency of care, including intensity, duration, and follow-up, is part of the planning process for nutrition interventions. Communicating the plan to the client and modifying the plan of care are all part of the nutrition intervention implementation; verifying that the plan is being followed occurs after implementation. 

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 3:: Nutrition Intervention.Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Communicating the plan to the client.

Explanation:
When planning a nutrition intervention, several steps are involved, including:

1. Assessing the client's nutritional status and needs
2. Setting goals and objectives for the intervention
3. Determining the appropriate strategies and interventions to achieve the goals
4. Communicating the plan to the client and other relevant parties (e.g., family members, healthcare providers)

The other options are related to the implementation and monitoring of the nutrition intervention plan, rather than the planning phase itself:

A. Defining the time and frequency of care is part of implementing the plan.
B. Verifying the plan is being followed is part of monitoring the plan's progress.
C. Modifying the plan of care is part of evaluating and adjusting the plan based on the client's response and progress.

Therefore, communicating the plan to the client (option D) is the step most directly involved in planning the nutrition intervention.
--------------------


429. In a foodservice operation, which of the following is the most critical point of control?
A. Menu B. Quality C. Distribution D. Food procurement 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The menu, a list of food items, serves as the primary control of the foodservice operation and is the common core to all functions. The menu controls each subsystem, is a major determinant for the budget, and reflects the “personality” of the foodservice operation. The menu affects the layout of the operation and the equipment needed to produce it.

References: Gregoire, M. Foodservice Organizations, A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston, MA:: Pearson; 2017:: 42. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The most critical point of control in a foodservice operation is quality.

Explanation:
While all the listed options are important aspects of a foodservice operation, quality is the most critical point of control for the following reasons:

1. Food safety: Maintaining high quality standards ensures that the food served is safe for consumption. This involves proper handling, storage, and preparation of food to prevent contamination and foodborne illnesses.

2. Customer satisfaction: The quality of food directly impacts customer satisfaction. Consistently serving high-quality, well-prepared meals helps to build a positive reputation and encourages repeat business.

3. Regulatory compliance: Foodservice operations must adhere to strict quality control regulations set by local health departments and other governing bodies. Failure to maintain quality standards can result in violations, fines, or even closure of the establishment.

4. Cost control: Maintaining quality helps to minimize waste and reduce costs associated with food spoilage or customer complaints. Consistently serving high-quality food can also justify higher menu prices.

While menu planning, distribution, and food procurement are essential aspects of a foodservice operation, they ultimately support the goal of maintaining high quality standards. Therefore, quality is the most critical point of control in a foodservice operation.

442. Which of the following is a true statement regarding organic foods?
A. Raw or processed agricultural products in the organic category may contain up to 5% non-organic ingredients allowed per the National List. B. Some operations are exempt from certification, including organic farmers who sell organic foods or crops worth $10,000 or less. C. Raw or processed agricultural products in the “100% organic” category must contain ingredients that are at least 90% certified organic. D. A product labeled as “MADE WITH” organic may use the USDA organic seal if no more than three ingredients are not certified. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: According to the USDA,  “Organic” can be used to label any product that contains a minimum of 95 percent organic ingredients (excluding salt and water). Up to 5 percent of the ingredients may be nonorganic agricultural products that are not commercially available as organic and/or nonagricultural products that are on the National List.

References: US Department of Agriculture. Labeling Organic Products.  Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Some operations are exempt from certification, including organic farmers who sell organic foods or crops worth $5,000 or less.

Let's go through the other options and explain why they are incorrect:

A. This statement is false. Raw or processed agricultural products in the organic category must contain at least 95% organic ingredients, not up to 5% non-organic ingredients.

C. This statement is false. Raw or processed agricultural products in the "100% organic" category must contain only organically produced ingredients and processing aids, excluding water and salt. The 90% requirement is for products labeled as "organic," not "100% organic."

D. This statement is false. A product labeled as "made with" organic ingredients must contain at least 70% organic ingredients. However, the USDA organic seal cannot be used on these products, regardless of the number of non-certified ingredients.

446. Older adults are at higher risk of toxicity of which of the following vitamins?
A. Vitamin A B. Vitamin C C. Vitamin D D. Vitamin K 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Plasma levels and liver stores of vitamin A increase with age, along with decreased clearance from the blood, making older adults more susceptible to toxicity. Vitamin D levels, on the other hand, decline with age. Vitamin C is water soluble and thus clearance is easier. Vitamin K levels usually can be controlled via medication.

References: Brown J. Nutrition Throughout the Life Cycle. 6th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2017. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Older adults are at a higher risk of toxicity from Vitamin D.

Explanation:
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it can accumulate in the body's fat stores. As people age, their kidneys become less efficient at removing excess vitamin D from the body, increasing the risk of toxicity.

Vitamin D toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis D, can lead to hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels), which may cause symptoms such as fatigue, confusion, excessive thirst, frequent urination, and in severe cases, kidney problems and calcification of soft tissues.

While the other vitamins mentioned (A, C, and K) can also have adverse effects when consumed in excessive amounts, older adults are not particularly at a higher risk of toxicity from these vitamins compared to other age groups.

It's important for older adults to follow the recommended daily allowance for vitamin D and consult with their healthcare provider before taking any vitamin D supplements to avoid potential toxicity.

447. Which of the following is an example of focus strategy?
A. Hospital nutrition services revises all patient menus to reflect condition-specific recommendations and restrictions B. Hospital convenes a consumer panel to offer feedback on proposed foodservice offerings C. Hospital begins marketing home meal replacements and delivery for its hospital staff D. Hospital system consolidates its dietary department managerial staff to be housed in one location 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Focus strategy uses a cost leadership or differentiation strategy to target a specific, limited-size market niche. This approach is exemplified in a hospital's plan to market home meal replacements and delivery for its hospital staff.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

A focus strategy is when a company targets a specific market segment and tailors its products or services to meet the unique needs of that segment. Among the given options, the best example of a focus strategy is:

A. Hospital nutrition services revises all patient menus to reflect condition-specific recommendations and restrictions

By revising patient menus to cater to specific health conditions and dietary restrictions, the hospital is focusing on a specific segment of its market (patients with particular health needs) and tailoring its services to meet those needs effectively.

The other options do not represent a focus strategy:

B. Convening a consumer panel for feedback is a form of market research, not a focus strategy.
C. Marketing home meal replacements and delivery for hospital staff is diversifying the hospital's services, not focusing on a specific segment.
D. Consolidating the dietary department managerial staff is an organizational change, not a focus strategy.

457. How many FTE(s) does it take to fill one 8-hour, 7-day-per-week position?
A. 1 B. 1.2 C. 1.4 D. 1.6 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 8 hours * 7 days = 56 hours / 40 hour workweek = 1.4 FTE

References: Keiser J, DeMicco, FJ. Contemporary Management Theory:: Controlling and Analyzing Costs in Foodservice Operations. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice Hall; 2000::260. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine the number of Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) needed to fill one 8-hour, 7-day-per-week position, we need to calculate the total number of hours per week and compare it to the standard full-time work week.

Given:
- The position requires 8 hours per day.
- The position needs to be filled 7 days per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours per week required for the position.
Hours per week = Hours per day × Days per week
Hours per week = 8 × 7 = 56 hours

Step 2: Compare the required hours per week to the standard full-time work week.
A standard full-time work week is typically 40 hours.

FTEs needed = Required hours per week ÷ Standard full-time hours per week
FTEs needed = 56 ÷ 40 = 1.4

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 1.4 FTEs are needed to fill one 8-hour, 7-day-per-week position.

460. Assuming that a patient's obesity is related to excessive energy intake is a form of which of the following?
A. Implicit bias B. Nutrition diagnosis C. Confirmation bias D. Behavioral theory 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Making assumptions about the etiology of a patient's obesity is a form of implicit bias. Implicit biases occur at the  unconscious level and are involuntarily formed. These unconscious attitudes may influence the quality of the care delivery. Confirmation bias involves seeking to validate ideas or concepts that an individual wants to be true. 

References: Puhl RM, Phelan SM, Nadglowski J, Kyle TK. Overcoming Weight Bias in the Management of Patients With Diabetes and Obesity. Clin Diabetes. 2016;34(1)::44-50.  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Confirmation bias.

Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that leads people to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports their prior beliefs or values. In this case, assuming that a patient's obesity is related to excessive energy intake without considering other potential factors demonstrates confirmation bias.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. While this assumption about obesity could be influenced by implicit bias, the question stem does not provide enough information to determine if implicit bias is the primary cause.

B. Nutrition diagnosis is the identification and labeling of a nutrition-related problem that dietetics practitioners are responsible for treating independently. The assumption in the question is not a nutrition diagnosis itself, but rather a potential bias in making a diagnosis.

D. Behavioral theory is a psychological theory that emphasizes the role of learning in the development of behaviors. The assumption about obesity being related to excessive energy intake is not directly related to behavioral theory.

477. Which of the following is the correct term to describe a storeroom within a university's residence hall foodservice that is staffed with a full-time employee?
A. Input B. Subsystem C. Interface D. Technical core 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A subsystem is a complete system unto itself (such as a storeroom) that is part of a larger system (in this case, a university residence hall foodservice).

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct term to describe a storeroom within a university's residence hall foodservice that is staffed with a full-time employee is:

D. Technical core

The technical core refers to the primary area or department within an organization where the main productive activities or services are carried out. In the context of a university's residence hall foodservice, the storeroom, which is staffed with a full-time employee, is a crucial part of the technical core as it is directly involved in the primary function of providing food services to the residents.

The other options have the following meanings:

A. Input: Resources or information that an organization receives from its environment to carry out its functions.
B. Subsystem: A smaller system or unit that operates within a larger system, contributing to the overall functioning of the organization.
C. Interface: A point of interaction or communication between different systems, subsystems, or components within an organization.

523. Labor costs for a roast beef dinner were $764, operating costs were $129, profit was $210, and the cost for food for the event was $895. Of the total production costs, what percentage was spent on food?
A. 47% B. 50% C. 73% D. 81% 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Total production costs include the cost of food, labor and overhead/operations costs. These costs include taxes, utilities, maintenance, etc. Profit is not included in the calculation as it is not a production cost.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2009. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Labor costs = $764
   * Operating costs = $129
   * Profit = $210
   * Cost of food = $895

2. Calculate the total production costs:
   * Total production costs = Labor costs + Operating costs + Cost of food
   * Total production costs = $764 + $129 + $895
   * Total production costs = $1,788

3. Calculate the percentage of total production costs spent on food:
   * Percentage spent on food = (Cost of food / Total production costs) × 100
   * Percentage spent on food = ($895 / $1,788) × 100
   * Percentage spent on food = 0.5006 × 100
   * Percentage spent on food ≈ 50%

Therefore, the correct answer is B. 50% of the total production costs was spent on food.

528. Why is it critical to use a valid and reliable malnutrition screening tool?
A. To limit unnecessary nutrition referrals B. So that any health care professional can complete the screening C. To diagnose nutrition-related health conditions D. So that there is consistency in who is screened  

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A malnutrition screening tool that is valid and reliable increases the likelihood of positively identifying possible malnutrition, thereby reducing referrals for individuals who do not have malnutrition. Screening is intended to identify risk and not evaluate and diagnose; as such, screening takes place before the Nutrition Care Process.

References: Skipper A, Coltman A, Tomesko J, et al. Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics:: Malnutrition (Undernutrition) Screening Tools for All Adults. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2019;120(4). Available at:: Website  

Claude 3 Response: 

The most critical reason to use a valid and reliable malnutrition screening tool is:

B. So that any health care professional can complete the screening

Here's why:

A valid and reliable malnutrition screening tool is designed to be simple and straightforward to use. It should not require extensive nutrition knowledge, allowing various health care professionals to administer the screening consistently. This ensures that patients at risk of malnutrition are identified early, regardless of which health care professional they interact with.

The other options, while important, are not the primary reasons for using a valid and reliable screening tool:

A. Limiting unnecessary nutrition referrals is a beneficial outcome but not the main purpose of the tool.

C. Malnutrition screening tools are not designed to diagnose nutrition-related health conditions; they identify patients at risk who may require further assessment and diagnosis.

D. Consistency in who is screened is important, but the key is that any trained health care professional can perform the screening, not that the same person always does it.

In summary, the most critical reason to use a valid and reliable malnutrition screening tool is that it allows any health care professional to complete the screening, enabling early identification of patients at risk of malnutrition.

537. Which area in a kitchen usually has the least amount of foot candles per square foot?
A. Dry-storage B. Utensil-storage C. Preparation D. Inside reach-in refrigerator 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Dry storage needs a minimum of 10 foot-candles. Utensil-storage and inside reach-in refrigerators need a minimum of 20 foot-candles. Preparation areas need a minimum of 50 foot-candles.

References: US Public Health Service. FDA Food Code. 2017. Accessed June 10, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The area in a kitchen that usually has the least amount of foot candles per square foot is:

D. Inside reach-in refrigerator

Foot candles (fc) measure the amount of light that falls on a surface, and the lighting requirements vary for different areas in a kitchen based on the tasks performed. Here's a general breakdown of the recommended foot candles for various kitchen areas:

1. Food preparation areas: 50-75 fc
2. Cooking areas: 30-50 fc
3. Food storage areas: 10-20 fc
4. Hand washing areas: 10-30 fc
5. Inside reach-in refrigerators: 5-10 fc

The inside of a reach-in refrigerator requires the least amount of light because it is not an area where tasks like food preparation or cooking are performed. The primary purpose of lighting inside a refrigerator is to help locate and identify items quickly.
--------------------


540. What type of flooring may be recommended for a food preparation area?
A. Wood B. Ceramic tile C. Carpet D. Linoleum 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Linoleum may be recommended for food preparation areas because it is resilient, nonabsorbent, and easily cleaned. Wood, ceramic tile, and carpeting are not appropriate for food preparation areas. 

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017:: 82. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The best answer for a food preparation area is:

B. Ceramic tile

Ceramic tile is often recommended for food preparation areas for several reasons:

1. Durability: Ceramic tiles are highly durable and resistant to wear and tear, making them suitable for high-traffic areas like kitchens.

2. Easy to clean: Ceramic tiles have a smooth, non-porous surface that is easy to clean and maintain. This is crucial in food preparation areas to maintain hygiene and prevent the growth of bacteria.

3. Water-resistant: Ceramic tiles are water-resistant, which is important in areas where spills and splashes are common.

4. Stain-resistant: Ceramic tiles are also resistant to stains, making them a practical choice for areas where food is prepared and consumed.

5. Variety of designs: Ceramic tiles come in a wide range of colors, patterns, and sizes, allowing for customization and aesthetic appeal in the kitchen.

The other options are less suitable for food preparation areas:
- Wood flooring can be damaged by moisture and is more difficult to clean thoroughly.
- Carpet is not recommended in food preparation areas as it can absorb spills, stains, and harbor bacteria.
- Linoleum, while water-resistant and easier to clean than carpet, is less durable than ceramic tile and may not withstand heavy use over time.

548. Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) increases when which of the following conditions is present?
A. Malnutrition B. Nephritis C. Hepatitis D. Hemolytic anemia 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: TIBC increases in individuals with hepatitis. TIBC decreases in individuals with malnutrition, nephritis, and hemolytic anemia. 

References: Raymond JL, McMorrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 66. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Hemolytic anemia.

Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is a measure of the blood's capacity to bind iron with transferrin, the main protein that transports iron in the blood. TIBC is increased in conditions where there is a higher demand for iron or when there is a decrease in iron stores.

Let's examine each option:

A. Malnutrition: In cases of malnutrition, particularly protein deficiency, TIBC may actually decrease due to reduced transferrin synthesis.

B. Nephritis: Nephritis, or inflammation of the kidneys, does not directly cause an increase in TIBC.

C. Hepatitis: Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can lead to a decrease in transferrin synthesis and, consequently, a decrease in TIBC.

D. Hemolytic anemia: In hemolytic anemia, red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. This leads to an increased demand for iron to produce new red blood cells. In response, the body increases transferrin production, resulting in an elevated TIBC.

Therefore, among the given options, hemolytic anemia is the condition that is most likely to cause an increase in TIBC.

560. A group of registered dietitian nutritionists meets with legislators to educate them on an important nutrition issue. This activity is known as
A. advocacy. B. lobbying. C. sponsorship. D. petitioning. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Advocacy is when an individual or group educates legislators or other government officials and advocates for change on issues they are passionate about. Lobbyists are professionals who are paid to visit Congress and advocate for specific issues. Sponsorship is when a legislator endorses and introduces a bill. In petitioning, a group signs a written request asking for a legislator to pass a bill.

References: Edelstein S. Nutrition in public health:: a handbook for developing programs and services. 3rd ed. Sudbury, MA:: Jones & Bartlett; 2010. Ebrahimkhel T. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Grassroots Advocacy 101. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2018;118(8)::1501-1505. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. lobbying.

Lobbying is the act of trying to influence the decisions made by officials in the government, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies. Lobbying is done by many types of people, associations, and organized groups, including individuals in the private sector, corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups (interest groups).

In this case, the group of registered dietitian nutritionists is meeting with legislators to educate them on an important nutrition issue. Their goal is to influence the legislators' decisions or actions related to this issue. This activity falls under the definition of lobbying.

The other options:

A. Advocacy: While lobbying can be a form of advocacy, advocacy is a broader term that includes public support for or recommendation of a particular cause or policy. Not all advocacy involves directly engaging with legislators.

C. Sponsorship: This usually refers to financial or material support of an event, activity, person, or organization.

D. Petitioning: This involves formally drawing requests or concerns to the government, often in written form and often from a large group of people. While petitioning can be a part of lobbying efforts, the activity described here involves direct meetings with legislators, which is more accurately described as lobbying.

571. When including a factor to represent non-urinary losses of nitrogen, calculation of nitrogen balance for a patient with a 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion of 14.3 grams and a protein intake of 102 grams would show a nitrogen balance of
A. +16.3 grams B. -16.3 grams C. -2 grams D. +2 grams 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Add 4 to the 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion. (The 4 accounts for non-urinary losses of nitrogen.) Determine nitrogen intake by dividing the daily protein intake by 6.25 nitrogen balance = 14.3 + 4 = 18.3; 102 ÷ 6.25 = 16.3; 16.3 – 18.3 = –2

References: Boullata J, Carney LN, Guenter P. A.S.P.E.N. Enteral Nutrition Handbook. Silver Spring, MD:: American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition; 2010::26. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To solve this problem, let's first understand what nitrogen balance is and how to calculate it. Nitrogen balance is the difference between the amount of nitrogen taken in (from protein) and the amount of nitrogen excreted (primarily through urine, but also through other non-urinary losses like feces, skin, and sweat).

Given:
- 24-hour urinary nitrogen excretion = 14.3 grams
- Protein intake = 102 grams
- We need to account for non-urinary losses of nitrogen

Step 1: Convert protein intake to nitrogen intake.
- Protein contains about 16% nitrogen by weight.
Nitrogen intake = Protein intake × 0.16
Nitrogen intake = 102 grams × 0.16 = 16.32 grams

Step 2: Calculate total nitrogen excretion by adding urinary and non-urinary losses.
- Non-urinary nitrogen losses are typically estimated to be about 4 grams per day.
Total nitrogen excretion = Urinary nitrogen excretion + Non-urinary nitrogen losses
Total nitrogen excretion = 14.3 grams + 4 grams = 18.3 grams

Step 3: Calculate nitrogen balance by subtracting total nitrogen excretion from nitrogen intake.
Nitrogen balance = Nitrogen intake - Total nitrogen excretion
Nitrogen balance = 16.32 grams - 18.3 grams = -1.98 grams (rounded to -2 grams)

Therefore, the correct answer is C. -2 grams. The negative nitrogen balance indicates that the patient is losing more nitrogen than they are taking in.

607.  Which of the following may be used as the basis for determining an appropriate portion size for a preschool-aged child?
A. Age B. Height C. Weight D. Food preferences 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: It has been recommended to offer toddlers and preschool children approximately 1 tablespoon of each food per meal for each year of the child’s age. 

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 332-333. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The most appropriate basis for determining an appropriate portion size for a preschool-aged child is:

C. Weight

Rationale:
- A child's weight is the most reliable indicator of their energy and nutrient needs. Portion sizes should be adjusted based on a child's weight to ensure they receive adequate nutrition for growth and development.

- Age (A) can provide a general guideline, but children of the same age can vary significantly in size and nutritional requirements.

- Height (B) is not as directly related to energy needs as weight. While taller children may need slightly larger portions, weight is a more accurate measure.

- Food preferences (D) should not be the primary determinant of portion sizes. While it's important to consider a child's preferences to encourage healthy eating habits, portion sizes should be based on nutritional needs rather than solely on what a child likes or dislikes.

In summary, while age, height, and food preferences can be considered when planning meals for preschool-aged children, weight is the most reliable basis for determining appropriate portion sizes to meet their nutritional needs.

622. Which of the following is true with regard to offering discounts for nutrition services?
A. Cash-paying clients should be excluded from receiving discounts B. Medicare and Medicaid recipients are ineligible for discounts to covered services C. Payors prefer that clients pay out of pocket when they are able, even for covered services D. Discounts for cash-paying clients should be offered based on insurance coverage 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Discounts are not allowed for Medicare and Medicaid recipients if the service is covered by their plan; however, discounts may be offered to this population for services that are not covered. Discounts should generally be offered consistently, regardless of method of payment. And many payors prohibit insured individuals from paying out-of-pocket for a covered service performed by a contracted provider.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Setting fees. Accessed February 13, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Medicare and Medicaid recipients are ineligible for discounts to covered services.

Here's why:

A. Cash-paying clients should be excluded from receiving discounts - This is incorrect. Cash-paying clients can be offered discounts, as long as they are not Medicare or Medicaid recipients receiving covered services.

B. Medicare and Medicaid recipients are ineligible for discounts to covered services - This is the correct answer. Offering discounts to Medicare and Medicaid recipients for services covered by these programs is generally prohibited and can be considered fraudulent.

C. Payors prefer that clients pay out of pocket when they are able, even for covered services - This is incorrect. Payors typically want clients to use their insurance coverage for covered services rather than paying out of pocket.

D. Discounts for cash-paying clients should be offered based on insurance coverage - This is incorrect. Discounts for cash-paying clients should be based on factors such as financial need, not insurance coverage.

In summary, while offering discounts to cash-paying clients is generally acceptable, it is important to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid recipients are not given discounts for services covered by these programs.

632. Which of the following might be mitigated with a grievance procedure?
A. Earning a lower salary than a coworker with same title and experience B. Discovering that coworkers are gossiping about employee’s personal life C. Getting an employee to stop stealing colleagues’ food from the lunchroom D. Being denied vacation time based on seniority 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A grievance is a complaint brought against an employer by an employee who believes a matter of law, fairness, or working conditions has been violated. Workplace gossip is an interpersonal matter and lunch theft is potentially up to human resources to address but neither scenario is generally escalated to grievance; vacation policies based on seniority are common in many workplaces and are not considered cause for grievances.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

A grievance procedure is a formal process that an employee can use to address and resolve workplace issues or conflicts. Among the given options, the one that might be best mitigated with a grievance procedure is:

A. Earning a lower salary than a coworker with the same title and experience

If an employee believes they are being paid unfairly compared to a colleague with the same job title and experience, they can use the grievance procedure to raise this issue with their employer. The grievance process allows the employee to present their case and request an explanation or resolution for the perceived pay disparity.

The other options are less likely to be addressed through a formal grievance procedure:

B. Discovering that coworkers are gossiping about an employee's personal life - While this is unpleasant, it is not typically a matter for a formal grievance unless it constitutes harassment or discrimination.

C. Getting an employee to stop stealing colleagues' food from the lunchroom - This is a behavioral issue that should be addressed directly with the individual or their supervisor, rather than through a grievance procedure.

D. Being denied vacation time based on seniority - Company policies regarding vacation time and seniority are usually clearly defined. If the decision aligns with the policy, a grievance procedure may not be appropriate. However, if the employee believes the policy is being applied unfairly, they might consider using the grievance process.

643. Which of these reflects proper storage practice
A. Raw meat placed above fresh broccoli B. Raw whole cuts of beef placed above raw fish C. Raw poultry placed above raw whole cuts of beef D. Raw fish placed above raw poultry 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The order of placement in the refrigerator is based on the minimum internal cooking temperature of each food. 

References: National Restaurant Association Education Foundation. ServSafe Coursebook. 6th ed. Chicago:: NRA; 2012::7-5. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Raw whole cuts of beef placed above raw fish.

When storing food in a refrigerator, it is essential to follow proper storage practices to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. The general rule is to store foods that require higher cooking temperatures on the upper shelves and foods that require lower cooking temperatures on the lower shelves.

The proper order for storing food in a refrigerator, from top to bottom, is:

1. Ready-to-eat foods (e.g., cooked meals, leftovers, prepared salads)
2. Whole fruits and vegetables
3. Whole cuts of beef and pork
4. Ground meats and fish
5. Whole and ground poultry

Therefore, option B, which states that raw whole cuts of beef should be placed above raw fish, is the correct storage practice among the given choices. Options A, C, and D are incorrect, as they violate the proper storage order and may lead to cross-contamination.

644. Which of the following oils is best suited for frying?
A. Olive B. Flax C. Coconut D. Grapeseed 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Grapeseed oil has a higher smoke point that is ideal for frying. Coconut oil is ideal for sautéing and baking, flax oil is ideal for use in smoothies and salad dressings, and olive oil is ideal for sautéing.

References: Edelstein S. Food Science:: An Ecological Approach. 2nd ed. Jones & Bartlett Learning; 2019:: 527. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The best oil for frying among the given options is:

C. Coconut oil

Coconut oil is well-suited for frying due to its high smoke point, which is around 350°F (177°C) for virgin coconut oil and even higher, about 400°F (204°C), for refined coconut oil. The smoke point is the temperature at which an oil starts to break down and produce smoke. Oils with higher smoke points are better for frying as they can withstand the high temperatures required for this cooking method.

The other oils mentioned have lower smoke points:

A. Olive oil: Extra virgin olive oil has a smoke point of about 325-375°F (165-190°C), while refined olive oil has a higher smoke point of about 465°F (240°C).

B. Flax oil: Flaxseed oil has a very low smoke point of about 225°F (107°C), making it unsuitable for frying.

D. Grapeseed oil: It has a moderately high smoke point of about 390°F (195°C), which makes it suitable for frying, but not as ideal as coconut oil.

649. What is often selected as the feeding route for preterm infants with nipple feeding problems caused by developmental immaturity?
A. Nasal gastric tube B. Bottle feeding C. Oral gastric gavage D. Transpyloric feeding tube 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Oral gastric gavage is a soft feeding tube inserted via the mouth and into the stomach. It is often used in preterm infants with nipple feeding problems caused by developmental immaturity. Although nasal gastric tube feeding generally may be better tolerated than oral feeding, preterm infants must breathe through their nose and this type of feeding compromises the airway. Transpyloric tube feeding is used in infants who have slow gastric emptying or are at risk for aspirating milk into the lungs. 

References: Morrow JL, Raymond K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 922. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. Nasal gastric tube.

Explanation:
Preterm infants often have difficulties with nipple feeding due to their developmental immaturity. This can lead to problems with sucking, swallowing, and breathing coordination. In such cases, an alternative feeding route is necessary to ensure that the infant receives adequate nutrition.

The most commonly selected feeding route for preterm infants with nipple feeding problems is the nasal gastric tube (NG tube). An NG tube is a thin, flexible tube that is inserted through the nose, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. This allows for the direct delivery of breast milk or formula into the infant's stomach, bypassing the need for nipple feeding.

The other options are less suitable for the given scenario:

B. Bottle feeding: This is not an appropriate choice for infants with nipple feeding problems, as it still requires the coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing.

C. Oral gastric gavage: This involves inserting a tube through the mouth into the stomach. While it serves a similar purpose to the NG tube, the nasal route is generally preferred as it is more comfortable for the infant and less likely to be dislodged.

D. Transpyloric feeding tube: This type of tube is inserted through the nose or mouth and passed through the stomach into the small intestine. It is used in specific situations where feeding directly into the stomach is not tolerated or contraindicated, which is not the case in the given scenario of developmental immaturity.

657. Which of the following is an example of conceptual skills in leadership?
A. Actively listening to subordinates' ideas for raising capital B. Explaining the impact of a recession on staff salaries C. Designing a portal for client communications D. Cross-training staff in performance evaluation completion 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Conceptual skills are rooted in ideas, whereas human skill is knowledge of and ability to work with people and technical skills are related to working with systems and processes. A leader with conceptual skills can comfortably discuss the organization's core ideas and the intricacies involved and can understand and communicate the economic principles that affect the company. Explaining the impact of a recession on staff salaries is a conceptual skill. Actively listening to subordinates' ideas for raising capital is a human skill and designing a portal for client communications is a technical skill. Cross-training staff in performance evaluation completion involves a combination of human and technical skills.

References: Northouse PG. Leadership:: Theory and Practice. Skills Approach. Sage; 2018.  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Designing a portal for client communications.

Conceptual skills in leadership refer to the ability to think creatively, solve complex problems, and develop innovative strategies. These skills involve seeing the "big picture" and understanding how various parts of an organization or system interact and influence each other.

659.  To make sure the correct service or treatment is delivered to the correct individual, what is an acceptable patient identifier in a health care setting?
A. Patient's phone number B. Patient's initials C. Patient's illness or condition D. Patient's age and sex 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The Joint Commission recommends using at least two patient identifiers when providing care, treatment, and services to avoid wrong-patient errors at all stages of diagnosis and treatment. Acceptable identifiers may be the individual’s full name, an assigned identification number, telephone number, or other person-specific identifier such as date of birth.

References: The Joint Commission. 2023 Ambulatory Care National Patient Safety Goals. Accessed March 31, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is:

D. Patient's age and sex

In healthcare settings, using at least two patient identifiers is a standard practice to ensure the correct patient receives the appropriate care, treatment, or service. However, age and sex alone are not considered sufficient identifiers.

Acceptable patient identifiers typically include:

1. Full name (first and last name)
2. Date of birth
3. Unique patient identification number (e.g., medical record number)

Other identifiers that may be used in conjunction with the above include:

4. Photograph
5. Barcode on patient's wristband
6. Last 4 digits of the patient's Social Security Number (in the United States)

Patient's phone number, initials, or illness/condition are not considered reliable identifiers, as they may not be unique to the individual or could lead to confusion and potential medical errors.

668. Calculate the labor cost percent of the following: Salaries: $40,240, Benefits: $3,100, Wages: $20,000, Total sales: $560,420
A. 11% B. 22% C. 8% D. 16% 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Calculate total cost of labor (salaries + wages + benefits) ÷ total number of sales. In this scenario, the organization has a labor cost of 11%: (40,240 + 3,100 + 20,000) ÷ 560,420 = 0.113.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practice. 12th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2011:: 474 

Claude 3 Response: 

To calculate the labor cost percent, we need to find the total labor cost and divide it by the total sales. Then, we'll multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Given:
- Salaries: $40,240
- Benefits: $3,100
- Wages: $20,000
- Total sales: $560,420

Step 1: Calculate the total labor cost.
Total labor cost = Salaries + Benefits + Wages
Total labor cost = $40,240 + $3,100 + $20,000 = $63,340

Step 2: Divide the total labor cost by the total sales.
Labor cost ratio = Total labor cost ÷ Total sales
Labor cost ratio = $63,340 ÷ $560,420 ≈ 0.1130

Step 3: Multiply the labor cost ratio by 100 to get the labor cost percent.
Labor cost percent = Labor cost ratio × 100
Labor cost percent ≈ 0.1130 × 100 ≈ 11.30%

The closest answer choice is A. 11%.

678. Which of the following is a recommendation for fruit juice consumption in infants and children?
A. Toddlers aged 1 to 3 years can be given 4 oz of fruit juice daily B. Fruit juice can be introduced in diluted form at age 6 months C. Children aged 4-6 years can be given up to 10 oz fruit juice daily D. Sippy cups should be used when serving fruit juice to toddlers 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends fruit juice not be given to an infant until age 1. Before age 1, infants can be encouraged to consume whole fruit that is mashed or pureed. After 1 year of age, because infants consume <1600 kcal/day, the AAP believes 4 oz juice per day is more than adequate.

References: Heyman MB, Abrams SA, AAP Section on Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, AAP Committee on Nutrition. Fruit Juice in Infants, Children, and Adolescents:: Current Recommendations. Pediatrics. 2017;139(6)::e20170967. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Fruit juice can be introduced in diluted form at age 6 months.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the following regarding fruit juice consumption in infants and children:

1. Juice should not be introduced into the diet of infants before 12 months of age unless clinically indicated.

2. Toddlers aged 1 to 3 years should be limited to 4 ounces (120 ml) of fruit juice per day. (Option A is incorrect)

3. Children aged 4 to 6 years should be limited to 4-6 ounces (120-180 ml) of fruit juice per day. (Option C is incorrect)

4. Juice should not be sipped throughout the day or used as a means to calm an upset child. Sippy cups should not be used as they promote continuous consumption. (Option D is incorrect)

5. Juice should not be introduced into the bottle and should only be served in a cup as part of a meal or snack to help reduce the risk of dental caries.

Therefore, the only correct statement among the given options is B, which states that fruit juice can be introduced in diluted form at age 6 months, although the current AAP recommendation is to wait until 12 months of age.

680. What is the recommended parts per million of available chlorine for a lukewarm, 1-minute chlorine bath used to sanitize dishes and utensils?
A. 10 B. 50 C. 100 D. 500 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: It is recommended that a minimum of 50 ppm available chlorine be used in a lukewarm chlorine bath to sanitize dishes and utensils.

References: Payne-Palacios J, Theis M. Foodservice Management Principles and Practice. 12th ed. Boston:: Prentice-Hall; 2012:: 105. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. 50 parts per million (ppm) of available chlorine.

According to food safety guidelines, when using a chlorine bath to sanitize dishes and utensils, the recommended concentration of available chlorine should be at least 50 ppm for a lukewarm (around 75-85°F or 24-29°C) solution with a contact time of at least 1 minute.

Here's a breakdown of the other options:

A. 10 ppm - This concentration is too low to effectively sanitize dishes and utensils.

C. 100 ppm and D. 500 ppm - While these concentrations would sanitize the items, they are higher than necessary and may cause excessive chlorine odor or taste on the sanitized items.

It's important to note that the water temperature and contact time are crucial factors in ensuring proper sanitation. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and local health department guidelines when preparing and using sanitizing solutions.

689. What may develop as a result of excessive milk consumption?
A. Megaloblastic anemia B. Hemolytic anemia C. Intestinal bleeding disorder D. Microcytic anemia 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Milk is low in iron content and larger intakes of milk (cow, goat, and soy) may displace high-iron foods, leading to iron-deficiency anemia. The most common cause of microcytic anemia is iron-deficiency anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. Hemolytic anemia is associated with vitamin E deficiency. 

References: Brown JE. Nutrition Through the Life Cycle. 6th ed. Belmont, CA:: Wadsworth; 2016:: 270. Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elseiver; 2021. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Intestinal bleeding disorder.

Explanation:
Excessive milk consumption in infants and young children can lead to intestinal bleeding, a condition known as milk-induced enterocolitis or milk protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (MPIES). This is an allergic reaction to milk proteins that causes inflammation and bleeding in the intestines.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Megaloblastic anemia: This type of anemia is caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, not by excessive milk consumption.

B. Hemolytic anemia: This condition occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. It is not typically associated with excessive milk intake.

D. Microcytic anemia: This type of anemia is characterized by smaller than normal red blood cells and is often caused by iron deficiency. While excessive milk consumption can contribute to iron deficiency by replacing iron-rich foods in the diet, it does not directly cause microcytic anemia.

In summary, excessive milk consumption in infants and young children can lead to intestinal bleeding disorder (MPIES) due to an allergic reaction to milk proteins.

705. When is it OK to store raw poultry immersed in ice? (Assume all other conditions for safe storage have been met.)
A. If it will be used by the end of the day B. If it will be used by the end of the week C. If it was received that way D. Never 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: If raw poultry or raw fish is received immersed in ice in shipping containers, they may be stored in that condition until preparation, display, service, or sale.

References: US Public Health Service. Food Code 2017. Accessed June 25, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Never.

It is never safe to store raw poultry immersed in ice, even if all other conditions for safe storage have been met. Here's why:

1. Risk of cross-contamination: When raw poultry is immersed in ice, the ice can become contaminated with bacteria from the poultry. As the ice melts, the contaminated water can spread to other foods stored nearby, potentially causing cross-contamination.

2. Inadequate temperature control: Storing raw poultry in ice may not maintain a consistent, safe temperature. The poultry may be in contact with ice that is above 40°F (4.4°C), which is the maximum safe temperature for storing raw poultry.

3. Potential for bacterial growth: If the ice melts and the poultry is left in the resulting water, it can create conditions that promote bacterial growth, even if the water is cold.

The proper way to store raw poultry is to keep it in a sealed container or wrapped securely in the refrigerator at a temperature of 40°F (4.4°C) or below. If you need to thaw frozen poultry, it should be done in the refrigerator, not by immersing it in water or ice.

708. Which vitamin deficiency is likely to develop in a patient with liver disease?
A. A B. E C. D D. K 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Vitamin D deficiency is frequently reported in liver disease patients and is thought to result from impaired synthesis and absorption.

References: Barchetta I, Angelico F, Del Ben M, et al. Strong association between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and low 25(OH) vitamin D levels in an adult population with normal serum liver enzymes. BMC Med. 2011;9(1)::85. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Vitamin K deficiency is likely to develop in a patient with liver disease.

Explanation:
Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in blood clotting and bone metabolism. The liver is responsible for the synthesis of several clotting factors that are dependent on vitamin K. In liver disease, the liver's ability to synthesize these clotting factors is impaired, which can lead to vitamin K deficiency and bleeding disorders.

Other reasons why vitamin K deficiency is associated with liver disease:

1. Bile is necessary for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin K. In liver disease, bile production and secretion may be reduced, leading to malabsorption of vitamin K.

2. Some liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, can cause malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K.

3. Alcoholic liver disease can also lead to vitamin K deficiency due to poor dietary intake and malabsorption.

The other vitamins mentioned:
- Vitamin A deficiency is not typically associated with liver disease.
- Vitamin E deficiency is rare and not specifically related to liver disease.
- Vitamin D deficiency can occur in liver disease, but it is not as common as vitamin K deficiency.

716. Which of the following has a potential causal relationship with cognitive decline and dementia?
A. B12 deficiency B. Excessive vitamin D intake C. Insulin resistance D. Soy allergy 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: B12 deficiency is associated with dementia. 

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elseiver; 2021:: 888. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Insulin resistance.

Explanation:
Insulin resistance has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Here's why:

1. Insulin plays a crucial role in brain function, including memory and learning. Insulin resistance in the brain can lead to impaired glucose metabolism, which is essential for proper brain function.

2. Insulin resistance is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which can contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

3. Studies have shown that individuals with type 2 diabetes, a condition characterized by insulin resistance, have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

The other options are not strongly associated with cognitive decline and dementia:

A. B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not a primary risk factor for dementia.
B. Excessive vitamin D intake is not known to cause cognitive decline or dementia.
D. Soy allergy is not related to cognitive function or dementia risk.

Therefore, among the given options, insulin resistance (C) has the strongest potential causal relationship with cognitive decline and dementia.

720. A long-term care facility requires a cook, server, trayline personnel, and supervisor for 8 hours daily to serve residents. How many full-time equivalents (FTEs) are needed to run the foodservice operation at this facility?
A. 4 FTEs B. 5.2 FTEs C. 5.6 FTEs D. 6.4 FTEs 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A full-time equivalent is based on the work done by a full-time employee, typically 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week, or 2,080 hours a year. In this question, the facility is open 7 days/week, so 4 positions x 8 hrs/day x 7 days/week = 224 hours/week. Divide hours needed by FTE (224 hours / 40 hours). The result is  5.6 FTEs.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2016 

Claude 3 Response: 

To calculate the number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) needed, we need to determine the total number of hours worked by all employees and divide it by the number of hours considered full-time per week.

Given:
- The facility requires a cook, server, trayline personnel, and supervisor.
- Each employee works 8 hours daily.
- We assume a full-time work week is 40 hours (5 days a week, 8 hours per day).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees daily.
Total daily hours = Number of employees × Hours worked per day
Total daily hours = 4 × 8 = 32 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees weekly.
Total weekly hours = Total daily hours × Number of working days per week
Total weekly hours = 32 × 7 = 224 hours

Step 3: Calculate the number of FTEs by dividing the total weekly hours by the number of hours considered full-time per week.
FTEs = Total weekly hours ÷ Full-time hours per week
FTEs = 224 ÷ 40 = 5.6

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 5.6 FTEs are needed to run the foodservice operation at this long-term care facility.

723. Which of following are defined by standards of identity?
A. How full a food product container must be B. What ingredients must be declared on a label C. Minimum specifications for quality requirements D. Serving size and nutrient analysis 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The Standards of Identity define what a given food product is, its name, and the ingredients which must or may be used, and which ones must be declared on the label. 

References: Science Direct. Standards of Identity. Accessed September 10, 2020. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

Among the options provided, standards of identity typically define:

B. What ingredients must be declared on a label

Standards of identity are established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certain food products. These standards set specific requirements for the composition and production of those foods, which includes the ingredients that must be used in the product.

The other options are not typically defined by standards of identity:

A. How full a food product container must be - This is usually regulated by net quantity of contents requirements.

C. Minimum specifications for quality requirements - Quality standards are separate from standards of identity and may be set by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), or other agencies depending on the product.

D. Serving size and nutrient analysis - These are determined by separate FDA regulations for nutrition labeling.

In summary, standards of identity primarily focus on the required ingredients and composition of specific food products, ensuring consistency across brands for consumers.

728. What is the recommended time frame for avoiding pregnancy after bariatric surgery?
A. 3-4 years B. 1-2 years C. 6-12 months D. 1-3 months 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Women are encouraged to avoid pregnancy for 1 to 2 years after bariatric surgery. Pregnancy during this time frame could result in complications related to potential nutrient deficiencies secondary to reduced food intake and malabsorption. 

References: Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics:: Obesity, Reproduction, and Pregnancy Outcomes. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2016;116::677-691. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The recommended time frame for avoiding pregnancy after bariatric surgery is typically 12-18 months, which falls under option C: 6-12 months.

The reasons for this recommendation include:

1. Rapid weight loss: In the first 12-18 months after bariatric surgery, patients experience rapid weight loss, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies that may affect fetal development.

2. Nutritional stabilization: Patients need time to adapt to new eating habits and ensure they are getting adequate nutrition, which is crucial for a healthy pregnancy.

3. Reduced complications: Waiting for 12-18 months allows the body to heal and reduces the risk of complications during pregnancy related to the surgical procedure.

4. Improved fertility: As patients lose weight, their fertility may improve, increasing the chances of conception. Waiting for the recommended time frame ensures the patient is in optimal health for pregnancy.

It's essential for patients to consult with their bariatric surgeon and obstetrician before planning a pregnancy to ensure the best possible outcomes for both the mother and the baby.

735. A foodservice has a 35% labor cost, 23% fixed costs, and a desired profit of 12%. Given a raw food cost of $4.55, what would be the selling price of an item when rounded up to $0.99 on the dollar?
A. $13.99 B. $14.99 C. $15.99 D. $16.99 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: First determine the divisor: Divisor – (labor cost + fixed costs + desired profit). In this case 100% – (35% + 23% +12%) = 100% – 70% = 30%. To calculate sales price: Cost/Divisor = $4.55/0.3 = $15.16. Round up to $15.99.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011 

Claude 3 Response: 

Let's solve this problem step by step. To find the selling price, we need to calculate the total cost and then add the desired profit.

Given:
- Labor cost: 35%
- Fixed costs: 23%
- Desired profit: 12%
- Raw food cost: $4.55

Step 1: Calculate the total percentage of costs and profit.
Total percentage = Labor cost + Fixed costs + Desired profit
Total percentage = 35% + 23% + 12% = 70%

Step 2: Let the selling price be x. Set up an equation based on the given information.
Raw food cost = (100% - Total percentage) × Selling price
$4.55 = (100% - 70%) × x
$4.55 = 0.3x

Step 3: Solve for x (the selling price).
x = $4.55 ÷ 0.3
x = $15.17

Step 4: Round up the selling price to $0.99 on the dollar.
The selling price rounded up to $0.99 on the dollar is $15.99.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. $15.99.

737. Which of the following saucepans would conduct heat most effectively?
A. 4 gauge B. 10 gauge C. 14 gauge D. 20 gauge 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The higher the gauge of a saucepan, the thinner the metal. Heavier stainless steel does not conduct heat well. Therefore, the best option in this case is a 20-gauge saucepan.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Prentice Hall; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine which saucepan would conduct heat most effectively, we need to understand the relationship between the gauge of the saucepan and its heat conductivity.

In the gauge system, a lower gauge number indicates a thicker material, while a higher gauge number indicates a thinner material. For example, a 10-gauge saucepan would have thicker walls than a 20-gauge saucepan.

Thicker materials generally conduct heat more effectively than thinner materials because they have more mass and can transfer heat more efficiently. Therefore, a saucepan with a lower gauge number (thicker walls) would conduct heat more effectively than a saucepan with a higher gauge number (thinner walls).

Among the given options:
A. 4 gauge
B. 10 gauge
C. 14 gauge
D. 20 gauge

The 4-gauge saucepan would have the thickest walls and, consequently, would conduct heat most effectively.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 4 gauge.

759. Among the following foods, which would be reintroduced last after bowel resection?
A. Mashed potatoes B. Coffee C. Bananas D. Strawberries 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Fluids and soft foods are reintroduced to the diet first following bowel resection. Coffee has proven to be effective in stimulating postsurgical bowel movements. It is recommended that eating any fresh fruit except bananas be delayed until 4-6 weeks postsurgery. 

References: Cleveland Clinic. Eating right and avoiding dehydration after surgery. Accessed March 12, 2021. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

After a bowel resection, the patient's diet is gradually advanced from clear liquids to a regular diet. The order in which foods are reintroduced depends on their digestibility and potential to cause gastrointestinal distress. Among the given options, the food that would be reintroduced last is:

D. Strawberries

The order of reintroducing the foods mentioned would likely be:

1. Clear liquids (not mentioned in the options)
2. Bananas - These are part of the BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) diet, which is often recommended after gastrointestinal surgery due to their low fiber content and ease of digestion.
3. Mashed potatoes - Soft, cooked vegetables like mashed potatoes are usually well-tolerated and introduced after the BRAT diet.
4. Coffee - Although not a solid food, coffee is a stimulant and can increase gut motility, so it would be introduced later in the diet progression.
5. Strawberries - Raw fruits, especially those with seeds like strawberries, are high in fiber and can be more difficult to digest. They are usually introduced last among the given options.

It's important to note that the specific diet progression may vary depending on the individual patient's condition and the surgeon's recommendations.

767. Which of the following is an effect of lung disease on nutritional status?
A. Increased appetite B. Increased intake due to fluid restriction C. Decreased energy expenditure, altered metabolism, decreased work of breathing D. Difficulty preparing food due to fatigue 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Shortness of breath related to lung disease can cause fatigue, which may affect a person’s ability to procure and prepare food and could result in poor nutritional intake.

References: Florian I. Nutrition and COPD. Todays Dietitian 2009; 11::54- 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. Decreased energy expenditure, altered metabolism, decreased work of breathing.

Lung diseases can have several effects on nutritional status:

1. Decreased energy expenditure: Lung diseases can limit physical activity, leading to a decrease in overall energy expenditure.

2. Altered metabolism: Chronic lung diseases can cause changes in metabolism, such as increased protein catabolism and altered glucose metabolism.

3. Decreased work of breathing: In some cases, lung diseases can reduce the efficiency of breathing, resulting in decreased work of breathing and lower energy expenditure.

The other options are not typically associated with the effects of lung disease on nutritional status:

A. Increased appetite: Lung diseases often lead to decreased appetite rather than increased appetite.

B. Increased intake due to fluid restriction: Fluid restriction is not a common recommendation for lung diseases and does not typically lead to increased intake.

D. Difficulty preparing food due to fatigue: While fatigue is a common symptom of lung diseases, it is not a direct effect on nutritional status. However, fatigue can indirectly affect nutrition by making it harder to prepare and consume meals.

790. Which of the following actions would likely be the result of systems thinking?
A. Select a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily. B. Reschedule kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations. C. Develop a catering menu for department meetings to generate revenue for equipment purchases. D. Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Systems thinking is the management approach to considering the entire organization when making decisions or allocating resources. Rescheduling kitchen staff to prepare food to meet customer expectations changes the kitchen and staff/resource entirely. Making a change to the produce delivery does not change the kitchen.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011::49. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Systems thinking is an approach that considers how different parts of a system interconnect and how changes in one area might affect the entire system. It involves looking at the bigger picture and understanding the relationships between various components.

Among the given options, the action that would most likely be the result of systems thinking is:

D. Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment.

This choice demonstrates a holistic view of the kitchen's operations and their impact on the larger ecosystem. By selecting eco-friendly cleaning products, the kitchen is considering not only its immediate needs but also the long-term effects on the environment. This decision shows an understanding of how the kitchen's choices can have far-reaching consequences beyond its own walls.

The other options, while potentially beneficial for the kitchen's operations, do not necessarily reflect systems thinking:

A. Selecting a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily focuses on a specific operational need rather than considering the broader system.

B. Rescheduling kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations addresses an immediate concern but does not consider the larger context.

C. Developing a catering menu for department meetings to generate revenue for equipment purchases is a financial strategy rather than a systems-thinking approach.

813. Which measurement is the basis for a standard scoop size or disher serving?
A. 1 cup B. 1 pint C. 1 quart D. 1 gallon 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Scoops and dishers are based on level servings per quart. The utensil size specifies the number of servings so, for example, a serving from a #8 disher or scoop yields 1/8 of a quart

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations, A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2016 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. 1 cup.

A standard scoop size or disher serving is based on a measurement of 1 cup. This is a common serving size for many foods, especially in the foodservice industry.

Here's some additional information:

1. Scoop sizes are often numbered, and these numbers correspond to the number of scoops it takes to make up one quart. For example, a #8 scoop holds approximately 1/2 cup, and it takes 8 of these scoops to make up a quart.

2. The most common scoop sizes are:
   - #6 (2/3 cup)
   - #8 (1/2 cup)
   - #10 (3/8 cup)
   - #12 (1/3 cup)
   - #16 (1/4 cup)

3. Scoops are used for portioning out consistent servings of foods like ice cream, mashed potatoes, cookie dough, and other semi-solid foods.

So, while pints, quarts, and gallons are all common measurements in the food industry, the standard scoop size or disher serving is based on a 1 cup measurement.

815. In patients with liver cirrhosis, reduction in respiratory quotient results from a metabolic switch to which primary fuel source?
A. Fatty acids B. Amino acids C. Glucose D. Water 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients with cirrhosis have respiratory quotients that are lower than controls after an overnight fast. This reduction in the respiratory quotient of patients with cirrhosis results from a metabolic switch in the primary fuel from glucose to fatty acids.

References: European Association for the Study of the Liver. EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on nutrition in chronic liver disease. J Hepatol. 2019;70::172-193. 

Claude 3 Response: 

In patients with liver cirrhosis, the reduction in respiratory quotient is a result of a metabolic switch to fatty acids as the primary fuel source.

Explanation:
1. Liver cirrhosis is a condition characterized by the replacement of normal liver tissue with scar tissue (fibrosis), leading to impaired liver function.

2. In advanced stages of liver cirrhosis, the liver's ability to store and metabolize glucose is significantly reduced. This leads to a decrease in the availability of glucose as a fuel source for the body.

3. As a compensatory mechanism, the body shifts its metabolism to utilize alternative fuel sources, primarily fatty acids. This metabolic switch is known as "fat oxidation" or "beta-oxidation."

4. The respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed during cellular respiration. The RQ value depends on the primary fuel source being metabolized:
   - Carbohydrates (glucose): RQ ≈ 1.0
   - Proteins (amino acids): RQ ≈ 0.8
   - Fats (fatty acids): RQ ≈ 0.7

5. When fatty acids become the primary fuel source, as in the case of liver cirrhosis, the RQ value decreases, reflecting the increased reliance on fat oxidation for energy production.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Fatty acids. The reduction in respiratory quotient in patients with liver cirrhosis results from a metabolic switch to fatty acids as the primary fuel source.

840. A 10 lb. beef roast costs $2.59/lb. The edible portion EP is 65%. What is the as purchased price of the beef roast?
A. $25.90 B. $259.00 C. $72.26 D. $46.36 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The as purchased price is calculated as $2.59/lb X 10 lb = $25.90. Edible portion percentage is not relevant to determining the as purchased price.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017:: 184. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The beef roast weighs 10 lbs.
   * The price per pound is $2.59.
   * The edible portion (EP) is 65%.

2. Calculate the as purchased (AP) price of the beef roast:
   * AP price = Weight of the roast × Price per pound
   * AP price = 10 lbs × $2.59/lb
   * AP price = $25.90

Therefore, the correct answer is A. $25.90.

851. A patient recently diagnosed with acute kidney injury has no evidence of chronic kidney disease but requires hemodialysis. If the patient is a 57-year-old male, weighs 70 kg, has a normal body mass index with no signs or symptoms of malnutrition, and skin is intact, what amount of protein should be recommended?
A. 105 g B. > 140 g C. 56-70 g D. 42 g 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Patients with acute kidney injury treated with hemodialysis demonstrate positive nitrogen balance with 1.5 g/kg/day of protein. 70 kg × 1.5 = 105 g. The other options underestimate or overestimate protein needs.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Nutrition Care Manual. Acute Renal Failure. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine the appropriate protein recommendation for this patient, we need to consider his acute kidney injury status, age, weight, and nutritional status. Let's break down the information given and analyze each answer choice:

Given:
- The patient has acute kidney injury and requires hemodialysis.
- No evidence of chronic kidney disease.
- 57-year-old male.
- Weighs 70 kg.
- Normal body mass index with no signs or symptoms of malnutrition.
- Skin is intact.

Protein recommendations for patients with acute kidney injury on hemodialysis:
- The recommended protein intake for patients with acute kidney injury on hemodialysis is 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day to maintain a positive nitrogen balance and support recovery.

Now, let's calculate the protein requirement for this patient:
- Protein requirement = 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day × 70 kg
- Protein requirement = 84-105 g/day

Analyzing the answer choices:
A. 105 g: This falls within the calculated range of 84-105 g/day and is an appropriate recommendation.
B. > 140 g: This is higher than the calculated range and may put unnecessary strain on the kidneys.
C. 56-70 g: This is lower than the calculated range and may not provide enough protein to support recovery and maintain a positive nitrogen balance.
D. 42 g: This is significantly lower than the calculated range and is not sufficient for the patient's needs.

Therefore, the best answer choice is A. 105 g of protein per day, as it falls within the recommended range for a patient with acute kidney injury on hemodialysis.

864. A pregnant client met with the RDN several times during the 1st trimester to manage nausea. That client is now in the third trimester and feels healthy and well.  What should the RDN do now?
A. Discontinue this episode of care B. Recommend bloodwork to check iron status C. Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments D. Transition care to another clinician to identify other potential problems 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When patient goals are met, the RDN should discontinue the episode of care.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 3:: Nutrition Intervention. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The best answer is B. Recommend bloodwork to check iron status.

Here's the rationale:

A. Discontinuing the episode of care is not appropriate. Although the client feels healthy, the third trimester is a crucial time for fetal growth and development, and nutritional needs are high. The RDN should continue to monitor and support the client.

B. Recommending bloodwork to check iron status is a good idea. Pregnant women are at risk for iron-deficiency anemia due to increased iron requirements for fetal growth and development. Checking iron status in the third trimester can help identify and address any deficiencies.

C. Scheduling additional monthly follow-up appointments may not be necessary if the client feels healthy and well. However, the RDN should still be available for support and guidance as needed.

D. Transitioning care to another clinician is not necessary if the RDN has been managing the client's care throughout the pregnancy. Continuity of care is important, and the RDN should continue to provide support and guidance unless there are specific reasons to involve another clinician.

In summary, while the client feels healthy in the third trimester, the RDN should still recommend bloodwork to check iron status, as this is a common concern during pregnancy. The RDN should continue to be available for support and guidance as needed throughout the remainder of the pregnancy.
--------------------


874. During the nutrition assessment, which of the following would an RDN document under Food and Nutrition-Related History to evaluate a client's risk for developing type 2 diabetes?
A. Factors affecting access to physical activity B. Primary language spoken in the home C. Central adiposity D. Blood glucose panel results 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Better neighborhood walkability and greater access to green space has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. These parameters are listed under Food and Nutrition-Related History in the Nutrition Care Process, so factors affecting access to physical activity is the correct answer. Primary language spoken in the home is a Client History assessment parameter, central adiposity is a Nutrition-Focused Physical Finding parameter, and glucose panel results are recorded under Biochemical Data, Medical Tests, and Procedures.

References: den Braver NR, Lakerveld J, Rutters F, et al. Built environmental characteristics and diabetes:: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Nutrition Care Process terminology. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

To evaluate a client's risk for developing type 2 diabetes, an RDN (Registered Dietitian Nutritionist) would document central adiposity under the Food and Nutrition-Related History section.

The correct answer is: C. Central adiposity

Explanation:
Central adiposity, or excess fat around the waist, is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Increased abdominal fat is associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, documenting central adiposity in the Food and Nutrition-Related History section is essential for assessing a client's risk for type 2 diabetes.

The other options are not directly related to the Food and Nutrition-Related History section or are not the most relevant factors for assessing type 2 diabetes risk:

A. Factors affecting access to physical activity would be documented under the Physical Activity and Function section, not the Food and Nutrition-Related History.

B. The primary language spoken in the home is not a direct risk factor for type 2 diabetes and would not be the most relevant information to document in this section.

D. Blood glucose panel results would be documented under the Biochemical Data, Medical Tests, and Procedures section, not the Food and Nutrition-Related History.

877. Which of the following is a malnutrition diagnosis in Nutrition Care Process terminology?
A. New-onset illness malnutrition B. Acute disease or condition-related malnutrition C. Nutrient deficiency-related malnutrition D. Chronic disease or condition-related malnutrition  

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The malnutrition diagnoses in the Nutrition Care Process terminology include the following: malnutrition (undernutrition), starvation-related malnutrition, chronic disease or condition-related malnutrition, acute disease or injury-related malnutrition, non-illness-related pediatric malnutrition, and illness-related pediatric malnutrition.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. Nutrition Diagnosis Terms and Definitions. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. Acute disease or condition-related malnutrition.

In the Nutrition Care Process (NCP) terminology, there are three main categories of malnutrition diagnoses:

1. Starvation-related malnutrition
2. Chronic disease or condition-related malnutrition
3. Acute disease or condition-related malnutrition

Let's analyze the given options:

A. New-onset illness malnutrition: This is not a standard NCP malnutrition diagnosis terminology.

B. Acute disease or condition-related malnutrition: This is one of the three main categories of malnutrition diagnoses in the NCP terminology. It refers to malnutrition that develops due to an acute illness or condition, such as surgery, trauma, or severe infection.

C. Nutrient deficiency-related malnutrition: While nutrient deficiencies can contribute to malnutrition, this is not a standard NCP malnutrition diagnosis terminology.

D. Chronic disease or condition-related malnutrition: Although this is one of the three main categories of malnutrition diagnoses in the NCP terminology, it is not the correct answer for this question, as the question is asking specifically about the acute disease or condition-related malnutrition diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Acute disease or condition-related malnutrition.

914. Which of the following is the fork drip test for IDDSI Level 4 Pureed/Extremely Thick?
A. Scooped sample sits in mound on fork and does not drip easily through prongs B. Small sample amount drips continuously through the prongs C. Sample drips slowly in dollops through the prongs, which do not leave a clear pattern D. Sample shows no sign of dripping through the prongs 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The fork drip test for the Level 4 Pureed/Extremely Thick diet of the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative requires that a scooped sample sits in mound on the fork and does not drip easily through prongs.

References: International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative. IDDSI Framework. Accessed March 13, 2020. Available at:: 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Sample shows no sign of dripping through the prongs.

According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI), the fork drip test for Level 4 Pureed/Extremely Thick consistency is described as follows:

"The sample should sit in a mound/pile above the fork. A small amount may flow through and form a tail below the fork, but it should not flow or drip continuously through the fork prongs."

Therefore, for a food to be classified as IDDSI Level 4 Pureed/Extremely Thick, it should show no sign of dripping through the prongs of a fork when tested using the fork drip test.

916. According to the Nutrition Care Process, if a client takes self-prescribed therapeutic doses of vitamin C, this information should be recorded in the _____ section of the Nutrition Assessment.
A. intake B. client history C. behavioral-environmental D. nutrition knowledge 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Any ingestion would be evaluated as part of the Intake category within Nutrition Assessment. Although the decision to self-prescribe could be related to the influence of attitudes and beliefs, behavioral-environmental parameters are a component of Nutrition Diagnosis in the Nutrition Care Process.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Nutrition Care Process Step 1:: Nutrition Assessment. Accessed November 8, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. client history.

In the Nutrition Care Process (NCP), the Nutrition Assessment is the first step, which involves collecting and analyzing relevant data about the client. The Nutrition Assessment is divided into several sections, including:

1. Food/Nutrition-Related History
2. Anthropometric Measurements
3. Biochemical Data, Medical Tests, and Procedures
4. Nutrition-Focused Physical Findings
5. Client History

The "client history" section is where a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) records information about the client's personal, medical, and family history, including any self-prescribed supplements or medications. In this case, the client's self-prescribed therapeutic doses of vitamin C should be documented in the client history section of the Nutrition Assessment.

The other options are incorrect because:
A. Intake: This section focuses on the client's food and nutrient intake.
C. Behavioral-environmental: This section includes information about the client's knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and food access.
D. Nutrition knowledge: This is not a specific section in the Nutrition Assessment. Information about the client's nutrition knowledge would be included in the behavioral-environmental section.

930. What number of productive FTEs are needed for two 7-day-per-week positions, working 6:30 am to 3:00 pm, with a 30-minute lunch?
A. 1.4 B. 2 C. 2.8 D. 2.975 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 2 * 8 hours * 7 days = 112 hours/ 40 hours week = 2.8 FTES

References: Keiser J, DeMicco FJ. Contemporary Management Theory:: Controlling and Analyzing Costs in Foodservice Operations. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice Hall; 2000::260. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total hours per shift:
   - Shift time: 6:30 am to 3:00 pm = 8 hours 30 minutes
   - Lunch break: 30 minutes
   - Actual work hours per shift = 8 hours 30 minutes - 30 minutes = 8 hours

2. Calculate the total hours per week for each position:
   - Each position works 7 days per week
   - Total hours per week for each position = 8 hours × 7 days = 56 hours

3. Calculate the total hours per week for both positions:
   - Total hours per week for both positions = 56 hours × 2 positions = 112 hours

4. Calculate the number of FTEs needed:
   - Assuming a standard full-time workweek is 40 hours
   - Number of FTEs needed = Total hours per week for both positions ÷ Standard full-time workweek
   - Number of FTEs needed = 112 hours ÷ 40 hours = 2.8 FTEs

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 2.8 FTEs are needed for two 7-day-per-week positions, working 6:30 am to 3:00 pm, with a 30-minute lunch.

977. What does a fasting blood glucose (FBG) of 129 indicate?
A. Normal blood sugar B. Diabetes C. Sugar spilling over into the urine D. Pre-diabetes 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A fasting blood glucose of 126 or higher indicates diabetes

References: American Diabetes Association. Standards of medical care in diabetes—2023. Diabetes Care. Accessed July 5, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

A fasting blood glucose (FBG) level of 129 mg/dL indicates pre-diabetes, which is option D.

Here's a breakdown of fasting blood glucose levels and their implications:

1. Normal: Less than 100 mg/dL
2. Pre-diabetes: 100-125 mg/dL
3. Diabetes: 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests

Pre-diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. It is a warning sign that an individual is at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke if lifestyle changes are not made.

Sugar spilling over into the urine (glycosuria) typically occurs when blood glucose levels exceed the kidney's reabsorption capacity, which is usually around 180 mg/dL.
--------------------


991. What is the maximum rate for providing dextrose via parenteral nutrition to a critically ill patient?
A. 5 mg/kg/minute B. 6 mg/kg/minute C. 7 mg/kg/minute D. 8 mg/kg/minute 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Rationale: When a person is experiencing ongoing catabolic process (such as critical illness), the maximum glucose oxidation rate is approximately 5 mg/kg/minute. Providing dextrose in amounts that exceed 5 mg/kg/minute may result in hyperglycemia and lipogenesis. Thus, dextrose provision should not exceed 5 m/kg/minute over a 24-hour period in critically patients. In patients who are stable and not critically ill, dextrose provision of 5-7 mg/kg/minute is generally tolerated. 

References: Charney P, ed. Pocket Guide to Parenteral Nutrition. 2nd ed. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; 2019:: 67-68. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The maximum rate for providing dextrose via parenteral nutrition to a critically ill patient is 5 mg/kg/minute.

Explanation:
In critically ill patients, it is important to carefully monitor and control the rate of dextrose administration to avoid complications such as hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and hepatic steatosis. The maximum safe rate for dextrose infusion is generally considered to be 5 mg/kg/minute.

Key points:
1. Excessive dextrose infusion rates can lead to hyperglycemia, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.
2. High dextrose infusion rates can also cause hyperosmolarity, leading to fluid shifts and potentially causing neurological complications.
3. Prolonged high dextrose infusion rates may result in hepatic steatosis due to increased de novo lipogenesis.
4. The maximum safe rate of 5 mg/kg/minute helps to minimize these risks while still providing adequate caloric support.

In summary, the correct answer is A. 5 mg/kg/minute, as this is the maximum safe rate for providing dextrose via parenteral nutrition to critically ill patients, balancing the need for caloric support with the prevention of complications associated with excessive dextrose infusion.

A. 3 cups air-popped popcorn, plain B. ½ cup cooked oatmeal, plain C. 2 cups milk D. ½ cup cooked corn 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Among the options listed, 2 cups milk is the highest in carbohydrate. 

References: US Department of Agriculture. Food Data Central. Accessed June 30, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine which option has the highest carbohydrate content, let's examine the typical carbohydrate values for each food:

A. 3 cups air-popped popcorn, plain
- 3 cups of air-popped popcorn contains approximately 18 grams of carbohydrates.

B. ½ cup cooked oatmeal, plain
- ½ cup of cooked oatmeal contains around 14 grams of carbohydrates.

C. 2 cups milk
- The carbohydrate content of milk varies depending on the type (whole, low-fat, or skim). On average, 2 cups of milk contain about 24-26 grams of carbohydrates.

D. ½ cup cooked corn
- ½ cup of cooked corn contains approximately 15-18 grams of carbohydrates.

Based on these values, the option with the highest carbohydrate content is:

C. 2 cups milk

With an average of 24-26 grams of carbohydrates, 2 cups of milk contain more carbohydrates than the other options listed.

1013. Which of the following is a recommended approach to dealing with theft in the workplace?
A. Use taking small items like pens and tape as examples of theft B. Avoid the topic until there is theft to avoid sounding accusatory C. Only speak on the topic of theft in meetings with individual employees D. Encourage employees to use their phone cameras for surveillance 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: It is recommended that conversations about workplace theft include giving specific examples of how stealing is wrong, even if it's a small item like a pen or tape dispenser that was taken. Preemptive discussions at staff meetings, in email, and on printed postings will help to make it clear that theft will not be tolerated and are preferred over waiting until there is a problem to address. Employees should be discouraged from taking matters into their own hands, so using phone cameras as surveillance tools is not recommended and may be illegal or against company policy.  

References: Wilkie D. Why is workplace theft on the rise? Society of Human Resource Management. March 2019. Accessed April 14, 2021. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The recommended approach to dealing with theft in the workplace is:

B. Avoid the topic until there is theft to avoid sounding accusatory

Explanation:
It's important to address the issue of theft in the workplace, but it should be done in a way that doesn't create a hostile or accusatory environment. Discussing theft when there is no specific incident can make employees feel distrusted and can negatively impact morale.

The other options are not recommended for the following reasons:

A. Using small items as examples of theft can trivialize the issue and may encourage employees to think that taking small items is acceptable.

C. Only speaking about theft in individual meetings can single out employees and create an atmosphere of distrust. It's better to address the topic in a general way with all employees.

D. Encouraging employees to use their phone cameras for surveillance can create a culture of suspicion and may violate privacy laws. It's better to have a formal security system in place if surveillance is necessary.

The best approach is to have a clear policy against theft and to address any incidents promptly and fairly, while maintaining a positive work environment built on trust and respect.

1033. Which of the following is best practice when translating educational materials from English to another language in a culturally sensitive way?
A. Contract with a native speaker of the language to do the translation B. Avoid translating until the text is written well in English C. Contract with one reviewer to check for cultural and linguistic appropriateness D. Translate the content word for word 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Rationale: Before translating a document, it should be written well in English, because if the original English text is too difficult, the translated text will probably also be too difficult. It cannot be assumed that native speakers of a given language are skilled at writing or at translating, so the person contracted to translate should it is more important that the translator be a professional translator than simply a native speaker. More than one individual should review the translation. Word-for-word, or literal, translations do not account for linguistic and cultural differences. 

References: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Toolkit for Making Written Material Clear and Effective:: Detailed guide for translations. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The best practice when translating educational materials from English to another language in a culturally sensitive way is:

A. Contract with a native speaker of the language to do the translation.

Here's why:

1. Native speakers have a deep understanding of the language's nuances, idioms, and cultural context, which helps ensure the translation is accurate and culturally appropriate.

2. While it's important to have well-written English content before translating (option B), it's not the most critical factor in culturally sensitive translation.

3. Having one reviewer (option C) can be helpful, but it's not as comprehensive as having a native speaker do the translation from the start.

4. Translating content word for word (option D) is not advisable, as it often leads to awkward, inaccurate, or culturally insensitive translations. Translations should capture the meaning and intent of the original content while adapting it to the target language and culture.

In summary, contracting with a native speaker of the target language is the best way to ensure that educational materials are translated accurately and in a culturally sensitive manner.

1040. The World Health Organization growth charts for children younger than age 2 are based on data from which of the following populations?
A. Infants who were primarily breastfed until at least 4 months of age and continued through 12 months B. Infants who were primarily breastfed until at least 6 months of age and continued through 12 months C. Infants who were formula fed due to free formula distribution for at least 12 months D. Infants who were primarily breastfed until at least 2 months of age and continued through 12 months 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Rationale: The WHO growth curves are expected to offer a single international standard that represents optimal physiological growth for all children from birth to 5 years of age and to establish the breastfed infant as the normative model for growth and development. The growth curves are based on data measured in infants who were primarily breastfed until age 4 months and continued through12 months.

References: www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. The World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts for children younger than age 2 are based on data from infants who were primarily breastfed until at least 6 months of age and continued through 12 months.

The WHO growth charts were developed using data from the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS), which was conducted between 1997 and 2003. The study included approximately 8,500 children from six countries: Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States.

The key criteria for the infants included in the study were:

1. They were exclusively or predominantly breastfed for at least 4 months.
2. They continued to be breastfed for at least 12 months.
3. They received complementary foods starting at 6 months of age.

The WHO growth charts are considered the international standard for assessing the growth and development of children from birth to 5 years of age. They provide a more accurate representation of normal child growth under optimal conditions, particularly for breastfed infants, compared to previous growth charts that were based on data from predominantly formula-fed infants.

1043. A cafeteria seats 100 customers. Lunch runs from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Turnover is two customers per hour. How many customers can be served during that time?
A. 200 B. 300 C. 400 D. 500 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 100 seats × 2 per hour = 200 customers per hour × 2 hour of lunch = 400 customers

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 8th ed. New York:: Pearson; 2013 

Claude 3 Response: 

Okay, let's organize the information we have:
* The cafeteria seats 100 customers at a time.
* Lunch runs for 2 hours, from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM.
* The turnover rate is two customers per hour, meaning each seat is occupied by two different customers every hour.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many customers can be served per seat during the lunch period:
   * Turnover rate = 2 customers per hour
   * Lunch duration = 2 hours
   * Customers served per seat = Turnover rate × Lunch duration
   * Customers served per seat = 2 × 2 = 4 customers

2. Now, we know the cafeteria has 100 seats, so let's calculate the total number of customers that can be served:
   * Total customers served = Customers served per seat × Number of seats
   * Total customers served = 4 × 100 = 400 customers

Therefore, the cafeteria can serve 400 customers during the lunch period from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The correct answer is C. 400.

87. A food provides 28 grams of carbohydrates, 8 grams of protein, and 7 grams of fat. What percent of this food's calories comes from fat?
A. 30% B. 33% C. 36% D. 38% 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Here are the steps to calculate:

References: Whitney EN, Rolfes S. Understanding Nutrition. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1) First, let's recall that carbohydrates and proteins provide 4 calories per gram, while fat provides 9 calories per gram.

2) Now, let's calculate the total calories from each macronutrient:

   Carbohydrates: 28g × 4 cal/g = 112 calories
   Protein: 8g × 4 cal/g = 32 calories
   Fat: 7g × 9 cal/g = 63 calories

3) Next, let's find the total calories in the food:

   Total calories = 112 + 32 + 63 = 207 calories

4) Now, to find the percentage of calories from fat, we divide the calories from fat by the total calories and multiply by 100:

   Percentage of calories from fat = (Calories from fat / Total calories) × 100
                                    = (63 / 207) × 100
                                    ≈ 30.4%

5) Looking at the options, 30% is the closest to 30.4%.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 30% of this food's calories come from fat.

934. Which of the following is best practice for writing a job description?
A. Target it specifically for the ideal candidate B. Present all information as short phrases in bulleted lists C. Include responsibilities no longer part of the job in case they are restored as requirements in the future D. Limit the job duties section to only 3-5 key responsibilities  

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: In best practice, a job description will include only 3-5 key responsibilities in the duties section. The description should be tailored to the basic skills and experience required of the job rather than targeting it for an ideal candidate, and it should only include what is currently required of the job and omit past or potential future requirements. Using complete sentences is recommended.

References: University of Pittsburgh, Department of Human Resources. Writing a job description. Accessed February 13, 2020. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The best practice for writing a job description is:

A. Target it specifically for the ideal candidate

Reasons:
1. Tailoring the job description to the ideal candidate helps attract the most qualified and suitable applicants for the position.
2. By focusing on the specific skills, experience, and qualities desired in the ideal candidate, the job description becomes more effective in communicating the role's requirements and expectations.
3. A targeted job description can help reduce the number of unqualified or unsuitable applicants, saving time and resources in the recruitment process.

The other options are not considered best practices for the following reasons:

B. While using short phrases and bulleted lists can improve readability, it should not be the only focus. A job description should still provide sufficient detail and context about the role.

C. Including outdated or irrelevant responsibilities can confuse applicants and detract from the current requirements of the position. It is best to keep the job description accurate and up-to-date.

D. Limiting the job duties section to only 3-5 key responsibilities may not provide a comprehensive picture of the role. While it's important to highlight the most critical aspects, the job description should cover all essential duties and responsibilities.

10. Increasing the amount of sugar in a recipe will have which of the following effects on gluten development and the mixing process?
A. Speed gluten development and require more manipulation B. Slow gluten development and require more manipulation C. Speed gluten development and require less manipulation D. Slow gluten development and require less manipulation 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: When sugar is added to a dough or batter mixture, the sugar will compete with the starch for the water in the dough or batter. Reducing the amount of available water will slow gluten development and will increase mixing (manipulation) times for the dough or batter.

References: McWilliams M. Foods:: Experimental Perspectives. 8th ed. New York City, NY:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. Slow gluten development and require less manipulation.

Explanation:
Sugar affects gluten development and the mixing process in the following ways:

1. Gluten development: Sugar competes with gluten proteins for water in the dough. When sugar is added, it binds to water molecules, making them less available for gluten formation. This results in slower gluten development, as the proteins need water to form a strong network.

2. Mixing process: Due to the slower gluten development caused by the addition of sugar, the dough will require less manipulation or mixing time. Overmixing a dough with high sugar content can lead to a tough, chewy texture because the gluten network will eventually form, but it will take longer than in a low-sugar dough.

In summary, increasing the amount of sugar in a recipe will slow down gluten development and require less manipulation during the mixing process to achieve the desired texture.

56. Which of the following represents the number of new cases of a condition that develops in a population over a specific period of time?
A. Incidence B. Prevalence C. Epidemiology D. Hazard 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Incidence reflects the number of new cases of a condition that develops in a population over a specific period of time. Prevalence reflects the percentage of a population with a specific characteristic in a given time period, regardless of when the characteristic first developed. Epidemiology is the study to determine the causes of disease and health outcomes in populations.  

References: Monsen ER. Research:: Successful Approaches. 3rd ed. Chicago:: ADA; 2008::58. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. Incidence.

Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a condition, disease, or health event that develops in a specific population over a defined period of time. It is a measure of the risk of developing a new condition within a specified period of time.

Let's briefly look at the other options:

B. Prevalence: This is the proportion of a population that has a specific condition at a given point in time. It includes both new and existing cases.

C. Epidemiology: This is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems.

D. Hazard: This is a potential source of harm or adverse health effects on a person or persons under certain conditions.

Therefore, incidence, which represents the number of new cases of a condition that develops in a population over a specific period of time, is the correct answer.

142. Which classic vitamin deficiency is known for the four Ds: dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death?
A. Thiamine B. Niacin C. Biotin D. Folic acid 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death are the typical symptoms of pellagra, a disease caused by niacin deficiency.

References: Gropper S, Smith J.  Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism. 6th ed. Belmont, CA:: Wadsworth; 2013. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The classic vitamin deficiency known for the four Ds: dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death is:

A. Thiamine (Vitamin B1)

Thiamine deficiency, also known as beriberi, can lead to a range of symptoms affecting the nervous system, cardiovascular system, and digestive system. The four Ds are associated with severe and prolonged thiamine deficiency:

1. Dermatitis: Skin inflammation and lesions
2. Dementia: Cognitive impairment and confusion
3. Diarrhea: Digestive disturbances and loose stools
4. Death: In extreme cases, untreated thiamine deficiency can be fatal

Thiamine is essential for proper energy metabolism, nervous system function, and heart health. It can be found in various food sources, such as whole grains, legumes, nuts, and fortified foods. Alcohol use disorder is a common cause of thiamine deficiency in developed countries.

185. What is the upper threshold for low birthweight?
A. 5.5 pounds B. 5.1 pounds C. 4.5 pounds D. 3.5 pounds 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: An infant born at 5.5 pounds or less is considered low birthweight.

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021.  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. 3.5 pounds (or 1,500 grams).

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), low birth weight is defined as a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams (5.5 pounds), regardless of gestational age. However, the term "very low birth weight" refers to babies born weighing less than 1,500 grams (3.5 pounds).

Here's a breakdown of the birth weight categories:

1. Normal birth weight: 2,500 grams (5.5 pounds) or more
2. Low birth weight (LBW): Less than 2,500 grams (5.5 pounds)
3. Very low birth weight (VLBW): Less than 1,500 grams (3.5 pounds)
4. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW): Less than 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds)

Therefore, the upper threshold for the "very low birth weight" category, which is a more severe classification than "low birth weight," is 3.5 pounds or 1,500 grams.

186. What comprises a PES statement?
A. possibilities, effects, solutions. B. problem, etiology, sign/symptoms. C. people, efforts, satisfaction. D. probabilities, end products, significant information. 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: PES refers to problem, etiology (or cause of problem), and the signs and symptoms that describe the nutrition problem.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, eNCPT. NCP Step 2:: Nutrition Diagnosis:: Communicating the nutrition diagnosis or problem statement:: PES. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is B. problem, etiology, sign/symptoms.

PES stands for Problem, Etiology, and Signs/Symptoms. It is a format used in nursing to create a nursing diagnosis statement. Here's what each component means:

1. Problem (P): The health issue or concern that the patient is facing, which requires nursing intervention.

2. Etiology (E): The cause, contributing factors, or reasons behind the health problem. This may include pathophysiological, psychological, sociocultural, or environmental factors.

3. Signs/Symptoms (S): The observable or measurable evidence that indicates the presence of the health problem. These can be objective (e.g., vital signs, lab results) or subjective (e.g., patient's reported symptoms).

A PES statement is written as: "Problem related to Etiology as evidenced by Signs/Symptoms."

The other options given do not correctly represent the components of a PES statement.

A. Completes a dietetic internship B. Attains RDN credential C. Has 3-5 years of practice experience D. Attains specialty certification 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The SOPP describes a competent practitioner as an individual  who has attained the RDN credential and consistently provides safe and reliable services

References: None 

Claude 3 Response: 

According to the Standards of Professional Performance (SOPP) for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs), a competent level of practice is defined as an RDN who has attained the RDN credential.

The correct answer is B. Attains RDN credential.

Here's a brief explanation of each option:

A. Completes a dietetic internship: While completing a dietetic internship is a necessary step to become an RDN, it is not part of the definition of a competent level of practice according to the SOPP.

B. Attains RDN credential: This is the correct answer. An RDN who has achieved a competent level of practice, as defined by the SOPP, has attained the RDN credential.

C. Has 3-5 years of practice experience: Having 3-5 years of practice experience is not part of the definition of a competent level of practice according to the SOPP. An RDN can achieve competence upon attaining the RDN credential, regardless of years of experience.

D. Attains specialty certification: Attaining a specialty certification is not a requirement for achieving a competent level of practice according to the SOPP. Specialty certifications demonstrate advanced knowledge and skills in specific areas of practice, but they are not necessary for competence as defined by the SOPP.

369. Which statement best describes the “A” component of the FADE performance improvement model?
A. Choose a specific problem or process to improve B. Review data to better understand the current process C. Create a plan D. Implement and monitor the plan 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The "A" component of the FADE model includes collection of data that are analyzed in order to establish baseline understanding of current processes. The process that will be improved is selected during the focus stage, action plans are developed during the development stage, and the plan is implemented during the execution stage.

References: Joint Commission Resources. Cost-Effective Performance Improvement in Hospitals. Oakbrook Terrace, IL:: JCAHO; 2005::95. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. Choose a specific problem or process to improve.

In the FADE performance improvement model, each letter represents a specific step:

F - Focus: This step involves choosing a specific problem or process that needs improvement. It's about identifying and prioritizing the areas that require attention.

A - Analyze: After selecting the focus area, the next step is to analyze the current situation, gather data, and identify the root causes of the problem or inefficiencies in the process.

D - Develop: Based on the analysis, the team develops a plan to address the identified issues and improve the process. This step involves creating specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals and action items.

E - Execute: The final step is to implement the developed plan, monitor its progress, and make necessary adjustments along the way to ensure the desired outcomes are achieved.

Therefore, the statement that best describes the "A" component of the FADE model is "Analyze," which involves reviewing data to better understand the current process.

463. Which of the following characteristics is key to an efficient and effective system?
A. Continuous response and adaptation to the system B. Flow of resources C. Interdependency of parts D. Achievement of subunit objectives 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: A system is a collection of interrelated parts or subsystems unified by design to obtain one or more objectives. Interdependency is the reciprocal relationship of the parts of a system; each part mutually affects the performance of the others. Interdependency emphasizes the importance of viewing the organization as a whole rather than as isolated parts. The other responses (ie, continuous response and adaptation to a system, flow of resources through a system, and achievement of subunit objectives) all are isolated parts of a system.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The key characteristic of an efficient and effective system is:

B. Flow of resources

Explanation:
An efficient and effective system is characterized by the smooth and uninterrupted flow of resources (such as information, materials, or energy) throughout the system. This flow enables the system to function optimally and achieve its overall objectives.

Let's examine why the other options are not the best choice:

A. Continuous response and adaptation to the system: While adaptability is important for a system to remain effective in changing environments, it is not the key characteristic that defines efficiency and effectiveness.

C. Interdependency of parts: Interdependency of parts is a crucial aspect of a system, as it ensures that all components work together harmoniously. However, it is not the primary factor in determining the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

D. Achievement of subunit objectives: While achieving subunit objectives is important, focusing solely on this aspect may lead to suboptimization, where the overall system's performance is compromised for the sake of individual components. An efficient and effective system should prioritize the achievement of the overall system objectives.

In summary, the flow of resources is the key characteristic that enables a system to operate efficiently and effectively, ensuring that all components receive the necessary inputs to perform their functions and contribute to the system's overall goals.

822. Which financial measurement is reflected in the equation below? (Cash + Accounts receivable + Marketable securities) ÷ Current liabilities
A. Acid-test ratio B. Profit margin C. Inventory turnover D. Debt-to-asset ratio 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The acid-test ratio, which is also called the quick ratio, is a means to accurately project ability to pay bills. In this equation, current liabilities are measured against cash and additional assets that can be readily converted to cash. 

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017:: 409.  

Claude 3 Response: 

The equation (Cash + Accounts receivable + Marketable securities) ÷ Current liabilities represents the Acid-test ratio, also known as the Quick ratio.

The correct answer is A. Acid-test ratio.

The Acid-test ratio or Quick ratio is a financial metric that measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets. It is a more stringent version of the Current ratio, as it excludes inventories, which are considered less liquid than cash, accounts receivable, and marketable securities.

The other options are different financial measurements:

B. Profit margin measures the profitability of a company by calculating the percentage of revenue that remains after subtracting expenses.

C. Inventory turnover measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory by calculating the number of times inventory is sold and replaced over a given period.

D. Debt-to-asset ratio measures the percentage of a company's assets that are financed by debt, indicating the company's financial leverage.

947. Which of these fruits has the lowest fructose content?
A. Guava B. Berries C. Papaya D. Watermelon 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Rationale: Fruits are a primary source of fructose, though fructose content varies. Berries are lower in fructose than guava, papaya, and watermelon.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Fructose Intolerance Nutrition Therapy. https:://www.nutritioncaremanual.org/client_ed.cfm?ncm_client_ed_id=27. Last accessed May 3, 2024. 

Claude 3 Response: 

B. Berries generally have the lowest fructose content among the given options.

Here's a breakdown of the typical fructose content in these fruits (per 100 grams):

1. Guava: 4-5 grams
2. Berries (varies by type):
   - Strawberries: 2-3 grams
   - Raspberries: 2-3 grams
   - Blackberries: 2-3 grams
   - Blueberries: 4-5 grams
3. Papaya: 3-4 grams
4. Watermelon: 3-4 grams

As you can see, most berries (except for blueberries) have a lower fructose content compared to guava, papaya, and watermelon. However, it's important to note that the exact fructose content may vary depending on the specific variety and ripeness of the fruit.

971. What is the minimal final rinse temperature for a nonchemical dishwasher?
A. 145 F B. 155 F C. 180 F D. 185 F 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Rationale: The minimal temperature requirement for a nonchemical dishwasher final rinse is 180°F .

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is C. 180°F (82°C).

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code, the minimum final rinse temperature for a nonchemical dishwasher, also known as a high-temperature dishwasher, is 180°F (82°C). This temperature is necessary to ensure proper sanitization of dishes, utensils, and other food-contact surfaces.

The high temperature of the final rinse water helps to kill harmful bacteria and other microorganisms that may be present on the surfaces of the items being washed. This is an important step in preventing foodborne illnesses in food service establishments.

It's important to note that chemical dishwashers, which use a chemical sanitizing solution instead of high-temperature water for the final rinse, have different temperature requirements. For these machines, the minimum temperature for the final rinse is typically lower, around 120°F (49°C), as the sanitization process relies on the chemical solution rather than the water temperature.

71. What is the upper limit of fat, in grams, that should be consumed by a healthy person requiring 2,500 kcal per day?
A. 875 B. 97 C. 218 D. 71 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Fat should be 35% or less of energy. 2500 kcal x 0.35 = 875 kcal from fat; 875 kcal from fat ÷ 9 kcal/g fat = 97 g fat

References: Whitney EN, Rolfes S. Understanding Nutrition. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

Claude 3 Response: 

To determine the upper limit of fat consumption for a healthy person requiring 2,500 kcal per day, we need to consider the recommended percentage of daily calories that should come from fat.

According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025, the recommended range for total fat intake is 20-35% of daily calories for adults.

Given:
- The person requires 2,500 kcal per day.
- The upper limit of the recommended fat intake is 35% of daily calories.

Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of calories that should come from fat.
Maximum calories from fat = 35% of 2,500 kcal
Maximum calories from fat = 0.35 × 2,500 = 875 kcal

Step 2: Convert the calories from fat to grams of fat.
1 gram of fat = 9 kcal
Grams of fat = Maximum calories from fat ÷ 9 kcal/g
Grams of fat = 875 kcal ÷ 9 kcal/g ≈ 97 g

Therefore, the upper limit of fat consumption for a healthy person requiring 2,500 kcal per day is approximately 97 grams (choice B).

285. Sustainability efforts in a foodservice operation include
A. using running water for rinsing. B. keeping lights on in all foodservice areas. C. breaking down cardboard boxes. D. using locally grown produce. 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Sustainable practices in foodservice are environmentally responsible practices that conserve natural resources, minimize the amount of waste, and support the production of food for many years to come. The only sustainable practice among these options is using locally grown produce. If the cardboard boxes are not just broken down but also recycled, then it would also be a sustainable effort.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is D. using locally grown produce.

Explanation:
Sustainability in foodservice operations involves practices that minimize the negative impact on the environment and support the local community. Using locally grown produce is a sustainability effort because it:

1. Reduces the carbon footprint associated with transportation, as the produce doesn't need to travel long distances.

2. Supports local farmers and the local economy.

3. Often results in fresher, higher-quality ingredients, as the produce can be harvested at peak ripeness and delivered quickly.

The other options are not considered sustainability efforts:

A. Using running water for rinsing wastes water and is not a sustainable practice.

B. Keeping lights on in all foodservice areas wastes energy and increases the carbon footprint of the operation.

C. Breaking down cardboard boxes is a good practice for recycling but is not directly related to sustainability efforts in foodservice operations.

337. If the beginning inventory for the month of January was overstated, what does this mean about how the cost of goods sold (COGS) and net income were reported?
A. The COGS was reported as more than it actually was, and the net income was reported as less than it actually was. B. The COGS was reported as less than it actually was, and the net income was reported as less than it actually was. C. The COGS was reported more than it actually was, and the net income was reported as more than it actually was. D. The COGS was correctly reported, and the net income for February will be reported as less than it actually is. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Beginning inventory serves as the basis for calculations of cost of goods purchased to meet production needs, the resulting cost of goods sold, and, consequently, the net income of the facility. Beginning with an overstated figure will appear as if the cost of goods sold was higher (adding the higher beginning inventory figure to the actual purchases made to meet production needs). This will also result in the appearance that it cost more to produce what was sold and therefore net income was lower.

References: Weygant, JJ, Kieso, DE, Kimmel, PD, DeFranco, AL. Hospitality Financial Accounting. 2nd ed. Hoboken, NJ:: Wiley; 2009. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. If the beginning inventory for January was overstated, it means that the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) was reported as more than it actually was, and consequently, the net income was reported as less than it actually was.

Here's the explanation:

1. COGS is calculated as: Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory
2. If the beginning inventory is overstated, it means that the COGS will be higher than it should be. This is because the overstated beginning inventory will lead to a larger difference between the beginning and ending inventories, thus increasing the COGS.
3. When COGS is overstated, it results in a lower reported net income. This is because net income is calculated by subtracting expenses (including COGS) from revenues. If expenses are overstated, net income will be understated.

Therefore, if the beginning inventory for January was overstated, the COGS was reported as more than it actually was, and the net income was reported as less than it actually was.

952. Which of the following is a concern in patients who require parenteral nutrition and are not receiving oral or enteral nutrition?
A. Decreased peristalsis B. Increased peristalsis C. Inadequate energy intake D. Infection from bacterial translocation  

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Rationale: Bacterial translocation is a common concern in patients who require parenteral nutrition and are not receiving oral or enteral nutrition; bacterial translocation can possibly result in infection.

References: McClave et al. Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in Critically Ill Patients:: Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N). JPEN. 2016;40 (2)::159-211. 

Claude 3 Response: 

The correct answer is A. Decreased peristalsis.

Explanation:
When patients are not receiving oral or enteral nutrition and are solely dependent on parenteral nutrition, there is a concern for decreased peristalsis, also known as intestinal atrophy or hypomotility.

Here's why:
1. Oral and enteral nutrition stimulate the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, promoting peristalsis and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa.
2. When the GI tract is not being used for an extended period, as in the case of exclusive parenteral nutrition, the intestinal muscles can atrophy, and peristalsis may decrease.
3. Decreased peristalsis can lead to complications such as intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which may increase the risk of bacterial translocation and sepsis.

The other options:
B. Increased peristalsis is not a typical concern in patients receiving parenteral nutrition without oral or enteral nutrition.
C. Inadequate energy intake is not directly related to the lack of oral or enteral nutrition, as parenteral nutrition can provide adequate energy if properly formulated.
D. While infection from bacterial translocation is a potential complication, it is a consequence of decreased peristalsis and intestinal atrophy rather than a direct concern.

953. Which of the foods listed has the highest environmental impact?
A. Orange B. Salmon C. Cow's milk D. Broccoli 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Rationale: Meat has been identified as having the highest greenhouse emissions, and thus the highest environmental impact, followed by dairy products, poultry, and fluid milk. (Note that according to the US Dietary Guidelines, meats comprise beef, goat, lamb, pork, and game meat such as bison, moose, elk, and deer.)

References: Heller M Keoleian G Greenhouse gas emission estimates of US dietary choices and food loss. J Industr Ecol. 2014;19(3)::391-401. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Position Paper:: Vegetarian Diets. J Acad Nutr Diet. 2016;116(12)::1970-1980. 

Claude 3 Response: 

Among the foods listed, salmon has the highest environmental impact.

Reasons:

1. Overfishing: Many salmon populations are overfished, which can lead to ecosystem imbalances and biodiversity loss.

2. Aquaculture: Farmed salmon can have negative impacts on the environment, such as water pollution, the spread of diseases to wild fish populations, and the use of wild-caught fish as feed.

3. Carbon footprint: Transporting salmon, especially by air, can result in a high carbon footprint.

In comparison:

- Oranges have a relatively low environmental impact, as they can be grown sustainably and have a lower carbon footprint when transported by sea or land.

- Cow's milk has a significant environmental impact due to greenhouse gas emissions from cattle, water usage, and land use for grazing and feed production. However, it still ranks lower than salmon.

- Broccoli has a low environmental impact, as it requires less water and land compared to animal-based foods and can be grown sustainably.

So, while cow's milk and salmon both have considerable environmental impacts, salmon ranks the highest among the given options.

984. Which of the following would be considered a transitional food according to the IDDSI framework?
A. Honey B. Ice cream C. Oatmeal D. Pudding 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: "Transitional foods" are substances that change quickly to become easier to chew or swallow with added moisture (eg, water or saliva) or a change in temperature. According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative framework, frozen desserts such as ice cream, sherbet, malts, and frozen yogurt and some potato chips are considered transitional foods.

Claude 3 Response: 

According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) framework, a transitional food is one that starts as one texture (usually firm) and changes to another texture, specifically when moisture (e.g., water or saliva) is applied or when a change in temperature occurs.

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

B. Ice cream

Ice cream is considered a transitional food because it starts as a solid (firm) texture when frozen but changes to a liquid texture as it warms up in the mouth. This change in texture requires minimal chewing, and the ice cream melts in the mouth, making it easier to swallow for individuals with dysphagia.

The other options:

A. Honey is a thick liquid and does not change texture.
C. Oatmeal is a soft food that requires some chewing and does not significantly change texture in the mouth.
D. Pudding is a soft food that maintains its texture and does not change significantly in the mouth.

Therefore, among the given options, only ice cream is considered a transitional food according to the IDDSI framework.
