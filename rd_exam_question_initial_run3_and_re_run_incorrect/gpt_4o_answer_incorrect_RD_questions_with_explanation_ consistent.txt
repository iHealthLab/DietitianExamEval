87. A food provides 28 grams of carbohydrates, 8 grams of protein, and 7 grams of fat. What percent of this food's calories comes from fat?
A. 30% B. 33% C. 36% D. 38% 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Here are the steps to calculate:

References: Whitney EN, Rolfes S. Understanding Nutrition. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2012. 

GPT Response: 

To determine what percent of the food's calories come from fat, we need to calculate the total calories provided by each macronutrient and then find the proportion of calories from fat.

First, we use the caloric values for each macronutrient:
- Carbohydrates provide 4 calories per gram.
- Protein provides 4 calories per gram.
- Fat provides 9 calories per gram.

Next, we calculate the calories from each macronutrient:
- Calories from carbohydrates: \( 28 \text{ grams} \times 4 \text{ calories/gram} = 112 \text{ calories} \)
- Calories from protein: \( 8 \text{ grams} \times 4 \text{ calories/gram} = 32 \text{ calories} \)
- Calories from fat: \( 7 \text{ grams} \times 9 \text{ calories/gram} = 63 \text{ calories} \)

Now, we find the total calories:
\[ 112 \text{ calories} + 32 \text{ calories} + 63 \text{ calories} = 207 \text{ calories} \]

To find the percentage of calories that come from fat, we use the following formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of calories from fat} = \left( \frac{\text{Calories from fat}}{\text{Total calories}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage of calories from fat} = \left( \frac{63}{207} \right) \times 100 \approx 30.43\% \]

Therefore, the closest answer is:
A. 30%

133. Approximately how many carbohydrate servings are 48 grapes?
A. 1 B. 2 C. 3 D. 4 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: There are roughly 15 grapes in 1 carbohydrate serving, so 48 grapes would provide approximately 3 carbohydrate servings.

References: Rolfes SR, Pinna K, Whitney E. Understanding Normal and Clinical Nutrition. 10th ed. Boston, MA:: Cengage; 2015. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the number of carbohydrate servings in 48 grapes, we need to know the carbohydrate content of grapes and the standard serving size for carbohydrates.

A standard serving of carbohydrates is typically considered to be 15 grams.

On average, a single grape contains about 1 gram of carbohydrate. Therefore, 48 grapes would contain approximately 48 grams of carbohydrates.

To find the number of carbohydrate servings, we divide the total grams of carbohydrates by the grams per serving:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ grams}}{15 \text{ grams per serving}} \approx 3.2 \]

So, 48 grapes would be approximately 3 carbohydrate servings.

The closest answer choice is:

A. 560 kcal B. 680 kcal C. 800 kcal D. 920 kcal 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: The kilocalories delivered by dextrose in solution is 3.4 kcal/g—not the typical 4 kcal/g—so the correct answer is 680 kcal. In 1 L of D40W, there is 400 g dextrose, but the patient is only receiving 500 ml; thus, 200 g dextrose x 3.4 kcal/g = 680 kcal.

References: McClave SA, Taylor B, Martindale RG, et al. Guidelines for the Provision and Assessment of Nutrition Support Therapy in the Adult Critically Ill Patient. JPEN J Paren Enteral Nutr. 2016;40(2)::159-211. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the number of kilocalories delivered by a parenteral formula of D40W (40% dextrose in water) of 500 ml, we need to calculate the amount of dextrose in grams and then convert that to kilocalories.

1. **Calculate the amount of dextrose in grams:**
   - D40W means 40% dextrose in water.
   - 40% of 500 ml is the amount of dextrose in grams.
   - 40% of 500 ml = 0.40 * 500 ml = 200 grams of dextrose.

2. **Convert grams of dextrose to kilocalories:**
   - Dextrose provides 3.4 kilocalories per gram.
   - Therefore, 200 grams of dextrose will provide: 200 grams * 3.4 kcal/gram = 680 kilocalories.

So, the number of kilocalories delivered is:

B. 680 kcal

A. 101 B. 98 C. 94 D. 95 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Determine the average number of entrees sold over the past 5 weeks
447 + 423 + 437 + 444 + 429 = 2180
2180 total entrees/5 weeks = 436 entrees/week
Calculate the popularity index for roast beef based on the entrée count the last time the menu was offered

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011. 

GPT Response: 

To forecast the number of portions of roast beef for next Friday, we can use the historical data provided. The first step is to calculate the average number of total entrees sold over the past five Fridays. Then, we can determine the proportion of roast beef sold last time and apply that proportion to the forecasted total for next Friday.

1. Calculate the average number of total entrees sold over the past five Fridays:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{447 + 423 + 437 + 444 + 429}{5} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{2180}{5} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 436 \]

2. Determine the proportion of roast beef sold last time:
\[ \text{Proportion of roast beef} = \frac{\text{Roast beef sold last time}}{\text{Total entrees sold last time}} \]
\[ \text{Proportion of roast beef} = \frac{96}{444} \]

3. Apply this proportion to the forecasted total for next Friday:
\[ \text{Forecasted roast beef} = \text{Proportion of roast beef} \times \text{Average total entrees} \]
\[ \text{Forecasted roast beef} = \left(\frac{96}{444}\right) \times 436 \]
\[ \text{Forecasted roast beef} = 0.2162 \times 436 \]
\[ \text{Forecasted roast beef} \approx 94.3 \]

Since the number of portions must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number:
\[ \text{Forecasted roast beef} \approx 94 \]

Therefore, the forecasted number of portions of roast beef for next Friday is:
\[ \boxed{94} \]


225. A recipe requires 1 3/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca. Tapioca is purchased in twelve 8-oz boxes in a case and costs $41.88 per case. Three cups of quick-cooking tapioca weighs 1 lb. What is the recipe cost for tapioca?
A. $2.33 B. $4.07 C. $5.24 D. $6.98 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: One case of tapioca contains twelve 8-oz boxes for a total of 6 lb (12 boxes * 7 0.5 lb = 6 lb). To calculate the price per pound:
$41.88 (total cost of case) ÷ 6 lb = $6.98 per pound
To calculate the price per cup, remember that 3 cups of tapioca weighs 1 lb:
$6.98 ÷ 3 cups = $2.33
To calculate the price per 1¾ cups (recipe cost): $2.33 × 1.75 = $4.07

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the recipe cost for tapioca, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the required tapioca from cups to pounds:**
   - The recipe requires 1 3/4 cups of tapioca.
   - We know that 3 cups of quick-cooking tapioca weigh 1 pound.

   Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of 1 3/4 cups in pounds:
   \[
   \frac{1 \text{ lb}}{3 \text{ cups}} = \frac{x \text{ lb}}{1.75 \text{ cups}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1.75 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ lb}}{3 \text{ cups}} = \frac{1.75}{3} \text{ lb} = 0.5833 \text{ lb}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per pound of tapioca:**
   - Tapioca is purchased in a case of twelve 8-oz boxes.
   - Each box is 8 ounces, so the total weight of a case is:
     \[
     12 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ oz/box} = 96 \text{ oz}
     \]
   - Convert ounces to pounds (since there are 16 ounces in a pound):
     \[
     96 \text{ oz} \div 16 \text{ oz/lb} = 6 \text{ lb}
     \]
   - The cost of a case is $41.88, so the cost per pound is:
     \[
     \frac{41.88 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ lb}} = 6.98 \text{ dollars/lb}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost for the required amount of tapioca:**
   - We need 0.5833 pounds of tapioca.
   - The cost per pound is $6.98, so the cost for 0.5833 pounds is:
     \[
     0.5833 \text{ lb} \times 6.98 \text{ dollars/lb} = 4.07 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the recipe cost for tapioca is \( \boxed{4.07} \).


254. If 48 lbs of cooked broccoli are needed and fresh broccoli yields 79% after trimming and cooking, how much fresh broccoli should be purchased?
A. 58 lbs B. 61 lbs C. 69 lbs D. 77 lbs 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: EP (edible portion)/%yield = AP (as purchased) 48 pounds ÷ .79 = 60.76 pounds (round to 61 pounds)

References: Ulm RA. How Much To Buy:: A Foodservice Purchasing Workbook. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 1993::19-22. 

GPT Response: 

To determine how much fresh broccoli should be purchased to yield 48 lbs of cooked broccoli, given that fresh broccoli yields 79% after trimming and cooking, you can use the following calculation:

Let \( x \) be the amount of fresh broccoli needed.

Since fresh broccoli yields 79% after trimming and cooking, this means that 79% of the fresh broccoli will be usable after cooking. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ 0.79x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{48}{0.79} \]

Now, perform the division:

\[ x \approx 60.76 \]

Since you typically can't purchase a fraction of a pound in practical scenarios, you would round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you should purchase approximately 61 lbs of fresh broccoli.

So, the correct answer is:

B. 61 lbs


258. Using the following figures, calculate the break-even point for a café: Fixed costs = $52,000; variable costs = $85,000; total sales = $210,000.
A. $86,666.66 B. $113,333.33 C. $130,000.00 D. $473,000.00 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Break-even point in sales = Fixed costs/Contribution margin ratio

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To calculate the break-even point, we need to determine the point at which total revenue equals total costs (both fixed and variable). The formula for the break-even point in sales dollars is:

\[ \text{Break-even point} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{1 - \frac{\text{Variable Costs}}{\text{Total Sales}}} \]

Given:
- Fixed Costs = $52,000
- Variable Costs = $85,000
- Total Sales = $210,000

First, calculate the variable cost ratio:

\[ \frac{\text{Variable Costs}}{\text{Total Sales}} = \frac{85,000}{210,000} \approx 0.4048 \]

Next, calculate the contribution margin ratio:

\[ 1 - \frac{\text{Variable Costs}}{\text{Total Sales}} = 1 - 0.4048 = 0.5952 \]

Now, use the break-even formula:

\[ \text{Break-even point} = \frac{52,000}{0.5952} \approx 87,363.64 \]

Since none of the provided options exactly match this result, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy. However, the closest option to our calculated break-even point is:

A. $86,666.66

Explanation: If the yield percent for apricots is 94%, multiply 24 pounds by 0.94 to get 22.56 pounds—this is the amount of trimmed apricots. Next divide 22.56 pounds by 6 pounds to determine how many batches of the recipe can be made. The answer is 3.76.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To determine how many batches of apricot jam can be made from a 24-lb bushel of apricots, given that the yield is 94%, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the usable amount of apricots from the 24-lb bushel.
2. Determine how many batches of jam can be made from the usable amount of apricots.

**Step 1: Calculate the usable amount of apricots.**

The yield is 94%, which means 94% of the 24-lb bushel is usable.

\[ \text{Usable amount} = 24 \, \text{lb} \times 0.94 \]

\[ \text{Usable amount} = 22.56 \, \text{lb} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many batches of jam can be made.**

The recipe calls for 6 lb of trimmed apricots per batch.

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Usable amount}}{\text{Amount per batch}} \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{22.56 \, \text{lb}}{6 \, \text{lb/batch}} \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 3.76 \]

So, the number of batches of jam that can be made from a 24-lb bushel of apricots is:

**A. 3.76 batches**

273. What inventory valuation method assumes that newer items are used before older items?
A. FIFO B. LIFO C. Latest purchase price D. Weighted average 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: LIFO (last in, first out) is based on the assumption that newer items are used before older items, in other words, that current purchases are largely meeting current production needs. FIFO (first in, first out) is based on using older items before newer items.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

The inventory valuation method that assumes newer items are used before older items is:

A. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)

FIFO assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold or used first, and therefore the cost of the older inventory is assigned to the cost of goods sold, while the cost of the newer inventory remains in ending inventory.

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: A number 4 scoop is 1 cup and there are 16 cups in a gallon.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To determine how many gallons of Greek yogurt are needed for 450 smoothies, we need to understand the volume measurements associated with the scoops and then convert that volume to gallons.

1. **Understand the scoop sizes:**
   - A number 4 scoop holds 8 fluid ounces.
   - A number 8 scoop holds 4 fluid ounces.

2. **Calculate the total volume of Greek yogurt needed for one smoothie:**
   - Each smoothie requires a number 4 scoop of Greek yogurt, which is 8 fluid ounces.

3. **Calculate the total volume of Greek yogurt needed for 450 smoothies:**
   - Total volume = 450 smoothies * 8 fluid ounces per smoothie
   - Total volume = 450 * 8 = 3600 fluid ounces

4. **Convert fluid ounces to gallons:**
   - There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon.
   - Total gallons needed = 3600 fluid ounces / 128 fluid ounces per gallon
   - Total gallons needed = 3600 / 128 ≈ 28.125 gallons

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, the closest answer is 28 gallons.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. 28 gallons


292. What product is more likely to be sold using a LIFO inventory approach?
A. Salmon portions B. Brick of cheddar C. Deli meat cuts D. Jar of spaghetti sauce 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The LIFO, or last-in/first-out, inventory approach is not practical for perishable goods of using newest inventory first. LIFO is better suited for nonperishable products, as perishable food could spoil while sitting idle in inventory, thereby leading to losses.

References: Tardi C. Inventory valuation:: LIFO vs FIFO. Investopedia. Updated April 2020. Accessed November 23, 2020. Available at:: Website 

GPT Response: 

The LIFO (Last In, First Out) inventory approach is typically used for products that do not have a high risk of spoilage and where the most recently acquired inventory is sold first. Given the options:

A. Salmon portions
B. Brick of cheddar
C. Deli meat cuts
D. Jar of spaghetti sauce

The most likely product to be sold using a LIFO inventory approach would be:

D. Jar of spaghetti sauce

This is because jarred spaghetti sauce has a longer shelf life compared to the other options, which are more perishable. Salmon portions, deli meat cuts, and bricks of cheddar cheese are more likely to be sold using a FIFO (First In, First Out) approach to minimize the risk of spoilage and ensure freshness.


300. A whole, bone-in ham weighs 18 lbs as purchased (AP) has an edible portion yield (EP) of 56%. Each ham costs $32.94. What is the invoice cost to serve 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham?
A. $155.55 B. $223.99 C. $277.78 D. $296.46 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: To get the edible portion yield per ham, multiply 18 lbs AP x 56% EP yield =10.08 lbs edible portion per ham. You need 85 lbs cooked sliced ham, so you would divide this amount by the edible portion per ham: 85 lbs ÷ 10.08 lbs = 8.43 hams. Thus, 9 hams are needed. Multiply the cost of the ham $32.94 x 9 hams = $296.46

References: Molt M, Shugart G. Food for Fifty. 13th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson Prentice Hall; 2011::190. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the invoice cost to serve 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the edible portion (EP) yield of one ham:**
   - The ham weighs 18 lbs as purchased (AP).
   - The EP yield is 56%.
   - EP weight of one ham = 18 lbs * 0.56 = 10.08 lbs.

2. **Determine how many hams are needed to get 85 lbs of cooked, sliced ham:**
   - Total EP needed = 85 lbs.
   - Number of hams needed = Total EP needed / EP weight of one ham.
   - Number of hams needed = 85 lbs / 10.08 lbs per ham ≈ 8.43 hams.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the required number of hams:**
   - Each ham costs $32.94.
   - Total cost = Number of hams needed * Cost per ham.
   - Total cost = 8.43 hams * $32.94 ≈ $277.78.

GPT Response: 

Systems thinking involves understanding how different parts of an organization interact and affect one another, and making decisions that consider the broader impact on the entire system. Let's analyze each option in this context:

A. **Select a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily** - This decision focuses on improving the quality and availability of produce, which could impact the kitchen operations, customer satisfaction, and potentially reduce waste. However, it is relatively narrow in scope and does not necessarily consider the broader organizational system.

B. **Reschedule kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations** - This decision involves changing staff schedules, which could affect labor costs, employee satisfaction, food quality, and customer satisfaction. It considers multiple aspects of the organization, including operations, human resources, and customer service, making it a good example of systems thinking.

C. **Develop a policy for using online job sites to attract applicants** - This decision focuses on recruitment and could impact the quality and quantity of job applicants, but it is primarily limited to the human resources function and does not necessarily consider the broader organizational system.

D. **Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment** - This decision considers the environmental impact of cleaning chemicals, which could affect employee health, customer perception, and the organization's sustainability goals. It reflects an understanding of the broader impact on the organization and its stakeholders, making it an example of systems thinking.

Given these analyses, the best example of systems thinking is:

**B. Reschedule kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations**

This option considers multiple facets of the organization, including operations, human resources, and customer satisfaction, and reflects a holistic approach to decision-making.

   - **Variety in flavors and textures:** The steamed fish, roasted cauliflower, and fresh pineapple provide different textures and flavors.
   - **Appealing presentation:** The colors and textures are varied, which can be visually appealing.

B. **Baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, rice pilaf, vanilla frozen yogurt with strawberries**
   - **Balance of nutrients:** This menu includes a protein (pork chop), a carbohydrate (rice pilaf), a vegetable (broccoli), and a fruit (strawberries).
   - **Variety in flavors and textures:** The baked pork chop, sautéed broccoli, and fresh strawberries offer different textures and flavors.
   - **Appealing presentation:** The combination of colors and textures is likely to be visually appealing.

C. **Grilled chicken breast, mashed potatoes, steamed parsnips, lemon sorbet**
   - **Balance of nutrients:** This menu includes a protein (chicken breast), a carbohydrate (mashed potatoes), and a vegetable (parsnips). The lemon sorbet adds a refreshing end to the meal.
   - **Variety in flavors and textures:** The grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, and steamed parsnips provide different textures, but the overall variety might be less exciting compared to the other menus.
   - **Appealing presentation:** The colors might be somewhat bland (mostly white and beige), which could affect visual appeal.

D. **Meatballs, tiny whole potatoes, Brussels sprouts, fresh bing cherries**
   - **Balance of nutrients:** This menu includes a protein (meatballs), a carbohydrate (potatoes), a vegetable (Brussels sprouts), and a fruit (cherries).
   - **Variety in flavors and textures:** The meatballs, whole potatoes, and Brussels sprouts offer different textures and flavors.
   - **Appealing presentation:** The colors and textures are varied, which can be visually appealing.

Based on these evaluations, **Menu A** and **Menu B** seem to reflect proper menu planning principles the best, as they offer a good balance of nutrients, a variety of flavors and textures, and an appealing presentation. **Menu D** also does well but might be slightly less varied in texture compared to A and B. **Menu C** is balanced but might lack visual appeal due to its color palette.


515. A hospital foodservice uses the FIFO inventory method.  On May 1, the hospital purchased 3 cans of pears at $6.66 each.  On May 15, they purchased 6 cans of pears at $6.72 each.  On May 31, they purchased 9 cans of pears at $6.78 each. When inventory was checked on June 1, it was determined that 12 cans of pears had been used. What is the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the 12 cans of pears?
A. $121.32 B. $79.92 C. $81.18 D. $80.64 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The first in, first out (FIFO) method assumes the first products a company has acquired are also the first products that it sells. Thus, using the FIFO method in this scenario, the cost of the older cans is used first. 

References: Investopedia. How to calculate the cost of goods sold using the FIFO method. Updated September 2019. Accessed December 15, 2020. Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the cost of goods sold (COGS) using the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) inventory method, we need to account for the cost of the oldest inventory first. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Inventory Purchases:**
   - May 1: 3 cans at $6.66 each
   - May 15: 6 cans at $6.72 each
   - May 31: 9 cans at $6.78 each

2. **Total Inventory:**
   - Total cans purchased = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18 cans

3. **Cans Used:**
   - 12 cans were used by June 1.

4. **FIFO Method:**
   - The first 3 cans used are from the May 1 purchase at $6.66 each.
   - The next 6 cans used are from the May 15 purchase at $6.72 each.
   - The remaining 3 cans used are from the May 31 purchase at $6.78 each.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of the first 3 cans: 3 cans * $6.66 = $19.98
   - Cost of the next 6 cans: 6 cans * $6.72 = $40.32
   - Cost of the remaining 3 cans: 3 cans * $6.78 = $20.34

6. **Total COGS:**
   - Total COGS = $19.98 + $40.32 + $20.34 = $80.64

Therefore, the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the 12 cans of pears is **$80.64**.

The correct answer is **D. $80.64**.


523. Labor costs for a roast beef dinner were $764, operating costs were $129, profit was $210, and the cost for food for the event was $895. Of the total production costs, what percentage was spent on food?
A. 47% B. 50% C. 73% D. 81% 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Total production costs include the cost of food, labor and overhead/operations costs. These costs include taxes, utilities, maintenance, etc. Profit is not included in the calculation as it is not a production cost.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2009. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the percentage of the total production costs that was spent on food, we first need to calculate the total production costs. The total production costs include labor costs, operating costs, and the cost for food.

Given:
- Labor costs: $764
- Operating costs: $129
- Cost for food: $895

First, we sum these costs to find the total production costs:
\[ \text{Total production costs} = \text{Labor costs} + \text{Operating costs} + \text{Cost for food} \]
\[ \text{Total production costs} = 764 + 129 + 895 \]
\[ \text{Total production costs} = 1788 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total production costs that was spent on food:
\[ \text{Percentage spent on food} = \left( \frac{\text{Cost for food}}{\text{Total production costs}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage spent on food} = \left( \frac{895}{1788} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, we perform the division and multiplication:
\[ \text{Percentage spent on food} = \left( \frac{895}{1788} \right) \times 100 \approx 50.06\% \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage spent on food} \approx 50\% \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. 50%

649. What is often selected as the feeding route for preterm infants with nipple feeding problems caused by developmental immaturity?
A. Nasal gastric tube B. Bottle feeding C. Oral gastric gavage D. Transpyloric feeding tube 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Oral gastric gavage is a soft feeding tube inserted via the mouth and into the stomach. It is often used in preterm infants with nipple feeding problems caused by developmental immaturity. Although nasal gastric tube feeding generally may be better tolerated than oral feeding, preterm infants must breathe through their nose and this type of feeding compromises the airway. Transpyloric tube feeding is used in infants who have slow gastric emptying or are at risk for aspirating milk into the lungs. 

References: Morrow JL, Raymond K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021:: 922. 

GPT Response: 

A. Nasal gastric tube

For preterm infants with nipple feeding problems due to developmental immaturity, a nasal gastric tube (also known as a nasogastric tube or NG tube) is often selected as the feeding route. This method allows for direct delivery of nutrition to the stomach, bypassing the need for the infant to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing, which can be challenging for preterm infants.


668. Calculate the labor cost percent of the following: Salaries: $40,240, Benefits: $3,100, Wages: $20,000, Total sales: $560,420
A. 11% B. 22% C. 8% D. 16% 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Calculate total cost of labor (salaries + wages + benefits) ÷ total number of sales. In this scenario, the organization has a labor cost of 11%: (40,240 + 3,100 + 20,000) ÷ 560,420 = 0.113.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practice. 12th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2011:: 474 

GPT Response: 

To calculate the labor cost percent, you need to sum up all the labor-related costs (salaries, benefits, and wages) and then divide that total by the total sales. Finally, multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Here are the steps:

1. Sum up all the labor-related costs:
   - Salaries: $40,240
   - Benefits: $3,100
   - Wages: $20,000

   Total labor costs = $40,240 + $3,100 + $20,000 = $63,340

2. Divide the total labor costs by the total sales:
   - Total sales: $560,420

   Labor cost percent = (Total labor costs / Total sales) * 100
   Labor cost percent = ($63,340 / $560,420) * 100

3. Calculate the percentage:
   Labor cost percent ≈ 0.1130 * 100
   Labor cost percent ≈ 11.30%

So, the labor cost percent is approximately 11%.

The correct answer is:
A. 11%


703. What is used to calculate protein needs in individuals with pressure ulcer?
A. Dietary Reference Intakes B. Bone mineral density C. Staging D. Age 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Dietary Reference Intakes and age are generally used to determine protein needs in healthy individuals. Protein needs in pressure ulcers are primarily based on pressure ulcer stage. 

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elsevier; 2021. 

GPT Response: 

A. Dietary Reference Intakes

The Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are used to calculate protein needs in individuals with pressure ulcers. The DRIs provide guidelines on the amount of protein and other nutrients required to support health and recovery, including in situations where there is increased need, such as with pressure ulcers. Factors like the severity of the ulcer (staging), age, and overall health status may also influence protein requirements, but the DRIs serve as the foundational reference for determining these needs.


708. Which vitamin deficiency is likely to develop in a patient with liver disease?
A. A B. E C. D D. K 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Vitamin D deficiency is frequently reported in liver disease patients and is thought to result from impaired synthesis and absorption.

References: Barchetta I, Angelico F, Del Ben M, et al. Strong association between non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and low 25(OH) vitamin D levels in an adult population with normal serum liver enzymes. BMC Med. 2011;9(1)::85. 

GPT Response: 

In patients with liver disease, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are more likely to develop due to impaired bile production and secretion, which are essential for the absorption of these vitamins. Among these, vitamin K deficiency is particularly notable because the liver plays a crucial role in producing clotting factors that depend on vitamin K. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. K


715. Which of the following is an expected outcome from obtaining a National Provider Identification (NPI) number?
A. To prevent other less-qualified nutritionists from obtaining one B. To share with prospective clients for an outpatient nutrition counseling center C. To obtain a certificate to display nutrition expertise D. To demonstrate adequate workforce capacity for Medicare payment policies 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The NPI serves as a "digital footprint" that can enable better understanding of the care provided, including specific nutrition interventions, RDN attribution to patient care, and the evaluation and reporting of outcomes and quality measures. The individual NPI is an important mechanism for demonstrating a viable workforce of RDN and NDTRs to external stakeholders, including public and private payors. All credentialed nutrition and dietetics practitioners (RDNs and NDTRs) should have an individual NPI regardless of work environment, employment status, or whether claims are submitted to payers

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Obtaining an NPI or EIN. Accessed August 23, 2021. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

The expected outcome from obtaining a National Provider Identification (NPI) number is:

B. To share with prospective clients for an outpatient nutrition counseling center

An NPI number is a unique identification number for covered health care providers in the United States. It is used in administrative and financial transactions, such as billing and claims processing, and can be shared with clients and other entities to facilitate these processes. It is not intended to prevent other nutritionists from obtaining one, to serve as a certificate of expertise, or to demonstrate workforce capacity for Medicare payment policies.


716. Which of the following has a potential causal relationship with cognitive decline and dementia?
A. B12 deficiency B. Excessive vitamin D intake C. Insulin resistance D. Soy allergy 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: B12 deficiency is associated with dementia. 

References: Raymond JL, Morrow K. Krause and Mahan's Food & the Nutrition Care Process. 15th ed. Elseiver; 2021:: 888. 

GPT Response: 

A potential causal relationship with cognitive decline and dementia can be found in:

A. B12 deficiency
C. Insulin resistance

### Explanation:

**A. B12 deficiency:**
Vitamin B12 is crucial for maintaining healthy nerve cells and red blood cells. A deficiency in B12 can lead to neurological issues, including cognitive decline and dementia. This is because B12 is essential for the production of myelin, which insulates nerve fibers and ensures proper nerve signal transmission.

**C. Insulin resistance:**
Insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, leading to higher blood sugar levels. This condition is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes and has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Insulin resistance can lead to inflammation and vascular damage, which can negatively impact brain health.

### Not directly linked:

**B. Excessive vitamin D intake:**
While vitamin D is important for overall health, excessive intake is not typically associated with cognitive decline or dementia. However, both deficiency and excessive intake of vitamin D can have other health implications.

**D. Soy allergy:**
A soy allergy is an immune response to proteins found in soy. While it can cause various allergic reactions, it is not directly linked to cognitive decline or dementia.


717. The standard recipe for the entrée makes 24 servings and each entrée serving is sold for $3.99. The sales goal for the entrée is $1200 total in one day. How many batches of the standard recipe should be prepared to meet the goal?
A. 10 B. 11 C. 12 D. 13 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: 1200/3.99= 300.75 entrees, 300.75 entrees/24 servings= 12.5, Round up to make 13 batches of the recipe to have enough entrees to sell to meet the sales goal.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To determine how many batches of the standard recipe should be prepared to meet the sales goal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings needed to meet the sales goal.
2. Determine how many batches of the standard recipe are required to produce that number of servings.

First, let's calculate the total number of servings needed to meet the sales goal of $1200.

Each serving is sold for $3.99. Therefore, the number of servings needed is:
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Sales goal}}{\text{Price per serving}} \]
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{1200}{3.99} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ \text{Number of servings} \approx 300.75 \]

Since you can't prepare a fraction of a serving, you need to round up to the next whole number:
\[ \text{Number of servings} = 301 \]

Next, we need to determine how many batches of the standard recipe are required to produce 301 servings. Each batch of the standard recipe makes 24 servings.

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total servings needed}}{\text{Servings per batch}} \]
\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{301}{24} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ \text{Number of batches} \approx 12.54 \]

Since you can't prepare a fraction of a batch, you need to round up to the next whole number:
\[ \text{Number of batches} = 13 \]

Therefore, the number of batches of the standard recipe that should be prepared to meet the sales goal is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]


735. A foodservice has a 35% labor cost, 23% fixed costs, and a desired profit of 12%. Given a raw food cost of $4.55, what would be the selling price of an item when rounded up to $0.99 on the dollar?
A. $13.99 B. $14.99 C. $15.99 D. $16.99 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: First determine the divisor: Divisor – (labor cost + fixed costs + desired profit). In this case 100% – (35% + 23% +12%) = 100% – 70% = 30%. To calculate sales price: Cost/Divisor = $4.55/0.3 = $15.16. Round up to $15.99.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011 

GPT Response: 

To determine the selling price of an item given the raw food cost and the percentages for labor, fixed costs, and desired profit, we can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{\text{Raw Food Cost}}{1 - (\text{Labor Cost %} + \text{Fixed Cost %} + \text{Desired Profit %})} \]

Given:
- Raw Food Cost = $4.55
- Labor Cost % = 35% = 0.35
- Fixed Cost % = 23% = 0.23
- Desired Profit % = 12% = 0.12

First, we need to sum the percentages for labor, fixed costs, and desired profit:

\[ \text{Total Percentage} = 0.35 + 0.23 + 0.12 = 0.70 \]

Next, we subtract this total percentage from 1 to find the portion of the selling price that is not covered by these costs and profit:

\[ 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 \]

Now, we can calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{4.55}{0.30} = 15.1667 \]

Finally, we round up to the nearest $0.99 on the dollar:

\[ \text{Rounded Selling Price} = $15.99 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. $15.99


737. Which of the following saucepans would conduct heat most effectively?
A. 4 gauge B. 10 gauge C. 14 gauge D. 20 gauge 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The higher the gauge of a saucepan, the thinner the metal. Heavier stainless steel does not conduct heat well. Therefore, the best option in this case is a 20-gauge saucepan.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 13th ed. Boston, MA:: Prentice Hall; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

The effectiveness of heat conduction in a saucepan is influenced by the thickness of its material. In the context of gauge numbers, a lower gauge number indicates a thicker material, while a higher gauge number indicates a thinner material.

Given the options:
A. 4 gauge
B. 10 gauge
C. 14 gauge
D. 20 gauge

The 4 gauge saucepan would be the thickest and, therefore, would conduct heat most effectively. Thicker materials generally provide better heat distribution and retention, which is beneficial for cooking.

So, the correct answer is:
A. 4 gauge


754. After a major flood, which of the following is OK to retain?
A. A screw-top jar of peanut butter B. A snap-top container of snack chips C. A box of infant formula D. A retort pouch of cashews 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Foods with retort pouches and cans are waterproof and safe to retain, so long as certain precautionary measures are followed, such as removing labels, thoroughly washing the pouches or cans with hot water (if available), brushing or wiping away any silt, and sanitizing by immersion. Jars and canisters with screw tops or snap lids and baby formula boxes are not waterproof and should be thrown out.

References: US Department of Agriculture. A Consumer's Guide to Food Safety:: Earthquakes and hurricanes. Accessed May 2, 2023. Edelstein S. Food Science:: An Ecological Approach. 2nd ed. Jones & Bartlett Learning:: 2019:: 331. 

GPT Response: 

After a major flood, it's crucial to be cautious about food safety due to potential contamination. Here's an assessment of each item:

A. **A screw-top jar of peanut butter**: This might be safe if the seal is intact and the jar shows no signs of damage or water intrusion. However, if the floodwater was contaminated, it's generally safer to discard it to avoid any risk of contamination.

B. **A snap-top container of snack chips**: These containers are not typically watertight, and floodwater could easily seep in. It's best to discard this item.

C. **A box of infant formula**: Cardboard boxes and their contents can easily be compromised by floodwater. Even if the formula inside seems dry, the packaging could have been contaminated. It's safest to discard it.

D. **A retort pouch of cashews**: Retort pouches are designed to be airtight and waterproof. If the pouch is undamaged and the seal is intact, it should be safe to retain. However, if there's any doubt about the integrity of the pouch, it's better to discard it.

In summary, the safest option to retain, provided it shows no signs of damage or contamination, is **D. A retort pouch of cashews**. However, always err on the side of caution with any food items exposed to floodwater.


757. Calculate the kcal from a 500 mL 20% intralipid in a parenteral nutrition regimen
A. 500 B. 750 C. 1,000 D. 1,250 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 500 mL × 2.0 kcal/mL = 1000 kcal

References: Charney P, Malone A. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Pocket Guide to Parenteral Nutrition. Chicago, IL:: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; 2007. 

GPT Response: 

To calculate the kilocalories (kcal) from a 500 mL 20% intralipid solution in a parenteral nutrition regimen, you need to know the caloric content of the intralipid solution.

A 20% intralipid solution contains 2 kcal per mL.

Here's the calculation:

1. Determine the total volume of the intralipid solution:
   - Volume = 500 mL

2. Determine the caloric content per mL of the 20% intralipid solution:
   - Caloric content = 2 kcal/mL

3. Multiply the total volume by the caloric content per mL:
   - Total kcal = Volume × Caloric content per mL
   - Total kcal = 500 mL × 2 kcal/mL
   - Total kcal = 1,000 kcal

Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. 1,000


759. Among the following foods, which would be reintroduced last after bowel resection?
A. Mashed potatoes B. Coffee C. Bananas D. Strawberries 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Fluids and soft foods are reintroduced to the diet first following bowel resection. Coffee has proven to be effective in stimulating postsurgical bowel movements. It is recommended that eating any fresh fruit except bananas be delayed until 4-6 weeks postsurgery. 

References: Cleveland Clinic. Eating right and avoiding dehydration after surgery. Accessed March 12, 2021. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

After a bowel resection, the reintroduction of foods into the diet is typically done gradually to allow the digestive system to adjust and to monitor for any adverse reactions. Among the options provided:

A. Mashed potatoes
B. Coffee
C. Bananas
D. Strawberries

**D. Strawberries** would likely be reintroduced last. This is because strawberries contain seeds and are high in fiber, which can be more difficult to digest and may irritate the healing bowel. Foods that are easier to digest and lower in fiber, such as mashed potatoes and bananas, are usually reintroduced earlier. Coffee, while not a solid food, can be irritating to the digestive system due to its acidity and caffeine content, so it might also be reintroduced later, but typically not as late as high-fiber foods like strawberries.


779. Which of the following is the best example of a SMART goal?
A. Lose 7% of my body weight by the end of the month by restricting my intake to 500 calories each day. B. Schedule more time to incorporate activity into my routine . C. Begin using mindfulness techniques when I am eating D. Buy walking shoes that fit before my RDN meeting next week 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, results focused, and time bound. Losing a specific percentage of body weight is potentially not achievable. The goals of scheduling more time for activity and using mindfulness techniques while eating should be more specific regarding what kind of activity/what kind of mindfulness techniques and the time frame in which they will be achieved. The goal of purchasing walking shoes specifies a time frame and is specific, measurable, and achievable.

References: Miller CK, Headings A, Peyrot M, Nagaraja H. Goal difficulty and goal commitment affect adoption of a lower glycemic index diet in adults with type 2 diabetes. Patient Educ Couns. 2012;86::84-90. 

GPT Response: 

The best example of a SMART goal is:

D. Buy walking shoes that fit before my RDN meeting next week.

This goal is Specific (buy walking shoes), Measurable (you can determine if you have bought the shoes or not), Achievable (buying shoes is a realistic task), Relevant (it supports a healthy lifestyle), and Time-bound (before the RDN meeting next week).

Let's break down why the other options are not as strong:

A. Lose 7% of my body weight by the end of the month by restricting my intake to 500 calories each day.
- This goal is specific, measurable, and time-bound, but it is not achievable or healthy. Consuming only 500 calories a day is dangerously low and not a sustainable or safe method for weight loss.

B. Schedule more time to incorporate activity into my routine.
- This goal is relevant and achievable, but it is not specific, measurable, or time-bound. It lacks details on how much time, what kind of activity, and by when.

C. Begin using mindfulness techniques when I am eating.
- This goal is relevant and achievable, but it is not specific, measurable, or time-bound. It does not specify which mindfulness techniques, how often, or by when you will start.

Therefore, option D is the best example of a SMART goal.


790. Which of the following actions would likely be the result of systems thinking?
A. Select a produce vendor who could deliver high-quality produce twice daily. B. Reschedule kitchen staff to prepare more foods from scratch to meet customer expectations. C. Develop a catering menu for department meetings to generate revenue for equipment purchases. D. Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment. 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Systems thinking is the management approach to considering the entire organization when making decisions or allocating resources. Rescheduling kitchen staff to prepare food to meet customer expectations changes the kitchen and staff/resource entirely. Making a change to the produce delivery does not change the kitchen.

References: Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Foodservice Management:: Principles and Practices. 12th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2011::49. 

GPT Response: 

Systems thinking involves understanding how different parts of a system interact and influence one another within the whole. It emphasizes the interconnections and interdependencies within a system, rather than focusing on individual components in isolation.

Given this definition, the action that most aligns with systems thinking is:

D. Select cleaning chemicals that do not harm the environment.

This choice reflects an understanding of the broader impact of the decision on the environment, which is a key aspect of systems thinking. It considers the long-term and wide-ranging effects of using certain chemicals, rather than just focusing on immediate needs or isolated outcomes.

A. 1 cup B. 1 pint C. 1 quart D. 1 gallon 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Scoops and dishers are based on level servings per quart. The utensil size specifies the number of servings so, for example, a serving from a #8 disher or scoop yields 1/8 of a quart

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations, A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2016 

GPT Response: 

The basis for a standard scoop size or disher serving is typically measured in terms of the number of scoops per quart. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. 1 quart

Standard scoops or dishers are often labeled with a number that indicates how many scoops make up a quart. For example, a #8 scoop means that 8 scoops equal one quart.


845. Which of the following represents indirect labor costs?
A. Full-time personnel B. Part-time personnel C. Contract employees D. Health insurance 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Indirect labor costs include benefits such as insurance, taxes, and paid time off

References: Puckett RP. Foodservice Manual for Health Care Institutions, 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ:: Wiley; 2012:: 218 

GPT Response: 

Indirect labor costs refer to expenses related to employees who are not directly involved in the production of goods or services but support the overall operations of the business. These costs are not easily traceable to a specific product or service.

Given the options:

A. Full-time personnel
B. Part-time personnel
C. Contract employees
D. Health insurance

The correct answer is **D. Health insurance**.

Health insurance is an example of an indirect labor cost because it is a benefit provided to employees and is not directly tied to the production of goods or services. The other options (A, B, and C) refer to different types of labor, which could be either direct or indirect depending on their roles within the company.


877. Which of the following is a malnutrition diagnosis in Nutrition Care Process terminology?
A. New-onset illness malnutrition B. Acute disease or condition-related malnutrition C. Nutrient deficiency-related malnutrition D. Chronic disease or condition-related malnutrition  

Difficulty Level: Difficult

897. Which of the following ingredients may negatively affect cardiovascular function in a person with high cola intake?
A. Citric acid B. Sodium C. Caramel coloring D. Phosphate 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: A high-phosphate intake has been shown to impair endothelial cell function in the vascular system. ”Free” (unorganically bound) phosphate that is added to food is very efficiently absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, unlike organically bound phosphate that occurs naturally in protein-dominant foods and some grain foods.

References: Ritz E, Hahn K, Kettler M, Kuhlmann MK, Mann I. Phosphate additives in food—A health risk. Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2012;109(4)::49-55. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

B. Sodium

High sodium intake is well-known to negatively affect cardiovascular function, particularly in individuals who consume it in large amounts. Excessive sodium can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension), which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. While citric acid, caramel coloring, and phosphate may have other health implications, sodium is the most directly linked to adverse cardiovascular effects.


905. Approximately how many patient trays per minute must a centralized assembly unit produce in order to serve 500 patients during a 90-minute mealtime?
A. 4 B. 4.5 C. 5 D. 5.5 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: To calculate, take the total number of trays and divide into 90 minutes

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2017 

GPT Response: 

To determine how many patient trays per minute a centralized assembly unit must produce to serve 500 patients during a 90-minute mealtime, we can use the following calculation:

1. **Total number of patients to be served**: 500
2. **Total time available in minutes**: 90

We need to find the number of trays produced per minute. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of patients by the total time available:

\[
\text{Trays per minute} = \frac{\text{Total number of patients}}{\text{Total time available in minutes}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Trays per minute} = \frac{500}{90} \approx 5.56
\]

Therefore, the centralized assembly unit must produce approximately 5.56 trays per minute. Since the options provided are whole or half numbers, the closest option is:

D. 5.5

The best practice for writing a job description is:

A. Target it specifically for the ideal candidate

This approach ensures that the job description is tailored to attract the most suitable candidates who possess the skills, experience, and attributes that align with the role and the company's needs. It helps in clearly communicating the expectations and requirements of the job, making it easier for potential candidates to determine if they are a good fit. 

While options B, C, and D have their own merits, they are not as comprehensive or effective as targeting the job description specifically for the ideal candidate. Here's why:

- B. Presenting information as short phrases in bulleted lists can improve readability, but it should not be the sole focus. The content and relevance of the information are more important.
- C. Including responsibilities no longer part of the job can create confusion and may deter potential candidates. It's better to keep the job description current and relevant.
- D. Limiting the job duties to only 3-5 key responsibilities might oversimplify the role and fail to provide a complete picture of the job. It's important to balance brevity with comprehensiveness.


944. The price of1 lb of broccoli heads is $2.05.  The yield for raw, trimmed broccoli is .81.  What is the edible portion price for 1 lb of broccoli?
A. $1.24 B. $1.66 C. $2.50 D. $2.53 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: EP price = As-purchased (AP) price ÷ EP yield. $2.05 ÷ 0.81 = $2.53 per pound. Determining edible portion (EP) cost is important for determining menu item costs and selling prices. The cost of fruits and vegetables in recipes must include the cost of trim, or expenses will be underestimated. EP cost includes the cost of the prepared product and the cost of trim.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 8th ed. New York:: Pearson; 2013:: 190 

GPT Response: 

To determine the edible portion price for 1 lb of broccoli, you need to account for the yield percentage. The yield percentage represents the portion of the broccoli that is edible after trimming.

Given:
- Price per pound of broccoli heads: $2.05
- Yield for raw, trimmed broccoli: 0.81 (or 81%)

The formula to calculate the edible portion price is:

\[ \text{Edible Portion Price} = \frac{\text{As Purchased Price}}{\text{Yield Percentage}} \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ \text{Edible Portion Price} = \frac{2.05}{0.81} \]

\[ \text{Edible Portion Price} \approx 2.53 \]

So, the edible portion price for 1 lb of broccoli is approximately $2.53.

The correct answer is:
D. $2.53


984. Which of the following would be considered a transitional food according to the IDDSI framework?
A. Honey B. Ice cream C. Oatmeal D. Pudding 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: "Transitional foods" are substances that change quickly to become easier to chew or swallow with added moisture (eg, water or saliva) or a change in temperature. According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative framework, frozen desserts such as ice cream, sherbet, malts, and frozen yogurt and some potato chips are considered transitional foods.

References: International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative. What are transitional foods? Accessed September 22, 2019. 

GPT Response: 

According to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI) framework, transitional foods are those that start as one texture and change to another when moisture (such as saliva) or temperature (such as body heat) is applied. 

Among the options provided:

A. Honey - This is a liquid and does not change texture in the mouth.
B. Ice cream - This can be considered a transitional food because it changes from a solid to a liquid when it melts in the mouth.
C. Oatmeal - This is typically a consistent texture and does not change significantly in the mouth.
D. Pudding - This is a consistent texture and does not change significantly in the mouth.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. Ice cream


998. What is the key organ for regulating the amount of carbohydrate in the blood?
A. Pancreas B. Liver C. Small intestine D. Gallbladder 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Rationale: The pancreas is the key metabolic organ for regulating how much carbohydrate is in the blood. The pancreas releases significant insulin amounts to downregulate the blood glucose level or releases glucagon to upregulate the blood glucose level.

References: Sánchez López de Nava A, Raja A. Physiology, Metabolism. StatPearls. Accessed August 27, 2021. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

B. Liver

The liver plays a crucial role in regulating the amount of carbohydrate in the blood. It helps maintain blood glucose levels by storing glucose as glycogen (glycogenesis) and releasing it when needed (glycogenolysis). The liver also participates in gluconeogenesis, the process of producing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources. While the pancreas is important for producing insulin and glucagon, which are hormones that regulate blood glucose levels, the liver is the key organ for directly managing carbohydrate storage and release.

Explanation: Among the options listed, 2 cups milk is the highest in carbohydrate. 

References: US Department of Agriculture. Food Data Central. Accessed June 30, 2023. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

To determine which option is highest in carbohydrates, let's look at the approximate carbohydrate content for each:

A. **3 cups air-popped popcorn, plain**: About 18 grams of carbohydrates.
B. **½ cup cooked oatmeal, plain**: About 14 grams of carbohydrates.
C. **2 cups milk**: About 24 grams of carbohydrates (assuming 12 grams per cup for regular milk).
D. **½ cup cooked corn**: About 15 grams of carbohydrates.

Based on these estimates, **2 cups of milk** (Option C) has the highest carbohydrate content at approximately 24 grams.


1031. Use the straight-line depreciation method to determine the total yearly cost for six ice machines that cost $5,000 each and will last for 10 years.
A. $3,000 B. $500 C. $30,000 D. $1500 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Depreciation per year equals the total value of the fixed asset divided by years of service. $5,000 x 6 = $30,000. $30,000 is the cost of 6 ice machines or the total value of the fixed asset. $30,000 ÷ 10 years = $3,000

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2017 

GPT Response: 

To determine the total yearly cost using the straight-line depreciation method, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total initial cost of the ice machines:**
   \[
   \text{Total initial cost} = \text{Cost per machine} \times \text{Number of machines}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total initial cost} = \$5,000 \times 6 = \$30,000
   \]

2. **Determine the useful life of the ice machines:**
   The useful life is given as 10 years.

3. **Calculate the annual depreciation expense:**
   \[
   \text{Annual depreciation expense} = \frac{\text{Total initial cost}}{\text{Useful life}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual depreciation expense} = \frac{\$30,000}{10} = \$3,000
   \]

Therefore, the total yearly cost for the six ice machines using the straight-line depreciation method is:
\[
\boxed{\$3,000}
\]


1033. Which of the following is best practice when translating educational materials from English to another language in a culturally sensitive way?
A. Contract with a native speaker of the language to do the translation B. Avoid translating until the text is written well in English C. Contract with one reviewer to check for cultural and linguistic appropriateness D. Translate the content word for word 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: Rationale: Before translating a document, it should be written well in English, because if the original English text is too difficult, the translated text will probably also be too difficult. It cannot be assumed that native speakers of a given language are skilled at writing or at translating, so the person contracted to translate should it is more important that the translator be a professional translator than simply a native speaker. More than one individual should review the translation. Word-for-word, or literal, translations do not account for linguistic and cultural differences. 

References: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Toolkit for Making Written Material Clear and Effective:: Detailed guide for translations. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

The best practice when translating educational materials from English to another language in a culturally sensitive way is:

A. Contract with a native speaker of the language to do the translation

This approach ensures that the translation is not only linguistically accurate but also culturally appropriate. Native speakers are more likely to understand the nuances, idioms, and cultural context of both the source and target languages, which is crucial for effective communication and cultural sensitivity. Additionally, it is often beneficial to have the translated material reviewed by another native speaker or a cultural expert to ensure the highest quality and appropriateness.
