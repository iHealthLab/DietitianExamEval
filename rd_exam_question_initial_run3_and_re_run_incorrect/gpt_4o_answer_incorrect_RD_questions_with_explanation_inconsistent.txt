776. What is the labor turnover if 7 employees in a department of 52 were terminated or quit?
A. 10% B. 11% C. 12% D. 13% 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: 7/52 * 100 = labor turnover of 13%

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations, A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Boston:: Pearson; 2016 

GPT Response: 

Labor turnover is calculated by dividing the number of employees who left by the total number of employees, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

In this case, 7 employees left out of a total of 52 employees.

Labor turnover = (Number of employees who left / Total number of employees) * 100
Labor turnover = (7 / 52) * 100

First, divide 7 by 52:
7 / 52 ≈ 0.1346

Then, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
0.1346 * 100 ≈ 13.46%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the labor turnover is approximately 13%.

So, the correct answer is:
D. 13%


10. Increasing the amount of sugar in a recipe will have which of the following effects on gluten development and the mixing process?
A. Speed gluten development and require more manipulation B. Slow gluten development and require more manipulation C. Speed gluten development and require less manipulation D. Slow gluten development and require less manipulation 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: When sugar is added to a dough or batter mixture, the sugar will compete with the starch for the water in the dough or batter. Reducing the amount of available water will slow gluten development and will increase mixing (manipulation) times for the dough or batter.

References: McWilliams M. Foods:: Experimental Perspectives. 8th ed. New York City, NY:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

B. Slow gluten development and require more manipulation

Increasing the amount of sugar in a recipe can slow down gluten development because sugar competes with the proteins in the flour for water. This competition reduces the hydration of the gluten-forming proteins, thereby slowing down the formation of gluten. As a result, more manipulation (mixing or kneading) is required to develop the gluten network properly.


244. A recipe requires 2 lb of cleaned, sliced strawberries. The yield from whole strawberries is 91%. At a minimum, how many pounds of strawberries need to be ordered?
A. 1.82 B. 2.20 C. 2.91 D. 4.40 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: EP/Yield = AP
2.0 ÷ 0.91 = 2.20 lb (rounded to nearest 100th)

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the minimum number of pounds of whole strawberries needed to yield 2 pounds of cleaned, sliced strawberries, you can use the yield percentage. The yield percentage is 91%, which means that 91% of the weight of the whole strawberries will be usable after cleaning and slicing.

Here's the calculation:

1. Let \( x \) be the weight of the whole strawberries needed.
2. The yield percentage is 91%, or 0.91 in decimal form.
3. The equation to find \( x \) is:
   \[
   0.91 \times x = 2 \text{ lb}
   \]

4. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ lb}}{0.91}
   \]

5. Calculate the value:
   \[
   x \approx 2.20 \text{ lb}
   \]

Therefore, at a minimum, you need to order approximately 2.20 pounds of whole strawberries. The correct answer is:

B. 2.20

A. "Because of" B. "Related to" C. "As a result of" D. "As evidenced by" 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The format for each nutrition diagnosis, or PES, statement is problem (P), etiology (E), signs and symptoms (S).

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. Communicating the Nutrition Diagnosis or Problem Statement. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

In a PES statement, the phrase that links signs and symptoms to etiology is:

B. "Related to"

A PES statement is used in the context of nursing diagnoses and stands for Problem, Etiology, and Signs/Symptoms. The structure typically follows this format:
- Problem (P) related to Etiology (E) as evidenced by Signs/Symptoms (S).

For example:
- "Impaired physical mobility related to muscle weakness as evidenced by difficulty in walking."

Here, "related to" links the problem (impaired physical mobility) to its etiology (muscle weakness).


864. A pregnant client met with the RDN several times during the 1st trimester to manage nausea. That client is now in the third trimester and feels healthy and well.  What should the RDN do now?
A. Discontinue this episode of care B. Recommend bloodwork to check iron status C. Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments D. Transition care to another clinician to identify other potential problems 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When patient goals are met, the RDN should discontinue the episode of care.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 3:: Nutrition Intervention. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

Given that the client is now in the third trimester and feels healthy and well, the RDN should consider the ongoing needs of the client during this critical period of pregnancy. Here are the considerations for each option:

A. **Discontinue this episode of care**: This might not be the best option as the third trimester is a crucial time for both the mother and the developing baby. Nutritional needs and potential issues should still be monitored.

B. **Recommend bloodwork to check iron status**: This is a reasonable option. Iron deficiency is common during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester due to increased blood volume and the needs of the growing fetus. Checking iron status can help ensure that the client is not anemic and is getting adequate nutrition.

C. **Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments**: This is also a good option. Regular follow-ups can help monitor the client's nutritional status, address any new concerns, and provide ongoing support and education as the pregnancy progresses.

D. **Transition care to another clinician to identify other potential problems**: This might be necessary if there are specific issues outside the RDN's scope of practice, but it doesn't seem necessary if the client is currently feeling well and there are no other identified problems.

Given the context, the most appropriate action would likely be a combination of B and C. Regular follow-ups (C) are important to ensure ongoing nutritional support and to address any new issues that may arise. Additionally, recommending bloodwork to check iron status (B) is a prudent step to ensure the client is not developing anemia, which is common in the third trimester.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**C. Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments**


1006. Improper food cooling methods can result in foodborne illness. Which of the following is the recommended time frame for cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF?
A. 1/2 hour B. 1 hour C. 2 hours D. 4 hours 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF should be done within 4 hours. Cooling foods from 140ºF to 70ºF should be completed within 2 hours. Proper food cooling techniques include use of shallow pans to reduce and divide the food, stainless steel storage containers to transfer heat from the food, and ice cubes. 

References: National Restaurant Association. Servsafe manager. Chicago, IL:: NRA Educational Foundation; 2014:: 6.16. 

GPT Response: 

The recommended time frame for cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF is D. 4 hours. 

According to food safety guidelines, the total cooling process should bring the temperature of the food from 135ºF to 70ºF within 2 hours, and then from 70ºF to 41ºF within an additional 4 hours. This helps to minimize the time food spends in the "danger zone" (40ºF to 140ºF), where bacteria can grow rapidly and potentially cause foodborne illness.


324. Among the following, which is the most important plan an onsite foodservice manager should have in place for emergency preparedness?
A. Menu plan B. Staffing plan C. Equipment plan D. Inventory plan 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The menu plan is the key for emergency preparedness. Menu plans vary depending on the type of emergency. Staffing, equipment, and inventory plans are important, but they all revolve around the menu planned for an emergency.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2016; 60. 

GPT Response: 

In the context of emergency preparedness for an onsite foodservice manager, the most important plan to have in place is:

**D. Inventory plan**

Here's why:

1. **Inventory Plan**: In an emergency, having a well-organized inventory plan ensures that the foodservice operation knows exactly what supplies are available and where they are located. This is crucial for maintaining food safety, managing resources efficiently, and ensuring that there is enough food and necessary supplies to continue operations or provide for those affected by the emergency.

2. **Menu Plan**: While important, the menu plan can be more flexible in an emergency. The priority is to ensure that there is food available, even if it means deviating from the usual menu.

3. **Staffing Plan**: A staffing plan is also critical, but it is secondary to knowing what resources are available. In an emergency, staff roles may need to be adjusted based on the available inventory and immediate needs.

4. **Equipment Plan**: Having a plan for equipment is important, especially if certain equipment is essential for food preparation and storage. However, without the necessary inventory, the equipment alone cannot ensure the continuation of foodservice operations.

In summary, while all these plans are important for comprehensive emergency preparedness, the inventory plan is the most critical as it directly impacts the ability to provide food and manage resources effectively during an emergency.

249. Using the factor pricing method, what would be the selling price for pasta primavera if the recipe cost is $2.65 raw food cost/portion and the desired percentage of food cost is 34%?
A. 2.94 B. 3.55 C. 5.59 D. 7.79 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The factor pricing method is also called the markup method. In this scenario, the price at which to sell an item is determined by multiplying the food cost by the desired percentage of food cost.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2017:: 418.
Payne-Palacio J, Theis M. Introduction to Foodservice. 11th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Prentice-Hall; 2008. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the selling price using the factor pricing method, you need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the pricing factor by dividing 100 by the desired food cost percentage.
2. Multiply the raw food cost per portion by the pricing factor to get the selling price.

Given:
- Raw food cost per portion = $2.65
- Desired food cost percentage = 34%

Step 1: Calculate the pricing factor.
\[ \text{Pricing Factor} = \frac{100}{\text{Desired Food Cost Percentage}} = \frac{100}{34} \approx 2.94 \]

Step 2: Multiply the raw food cost per portion by the pricing factor.
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \text{Raw Food Cost per Portion} \times \text{Pricing Factor} \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 2.65 \times 2.94 \approx 7.79 \]

Therefore, the selling price for pasta primavera would be approximately $7.79.

The correct answer is:
D. 7.79


291. According to the Food Code, a consumer advisory must be posted or available at a self-service unit where raw or partially cooked food is held for service and readily accessible. What is the exception to this requirement?
A. Catered events B. Salad bars C. Sushi bars D. Self-selection display cases 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: The food code requires that buffets, salad bars, sushi bars, and display cases post a consumer advisory when raw or partially cooked food is held for service and readily accessible to consumers before they select their foods. However, in a catered situation like a wedding reception, guests are responsible for making their own requests or selections.

References: US Public Health Service. FDA Food Code. 2017. Accessed May 7, 2020. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

The exception to the requirement of posting a consumer advisory at a self-service unit where raw or partially cooked food is held for service and readily accessible is:

A. Catered events

Catered events are typically considered private functions where the food is prepared and served under controlled conditions, and the guests are often informed about the menu and any potential risks by the catering service. Therefore, the same consumer advisory requirements that apply to public self-service units may not be necessary.


299. One pound of turkey as purchased yields .35 lb cooked turkey without skin. The cost of the turkey breast is $1.19 per pound. What is the cost of a 4-ounce serving?
A. $0.85 B. $0.42 C. $0.36 D. $8.50 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: Formula: AP price/EP yield = EP price

References: Lynch FT. The Book of Yields. 8th ed. Hoboken, NJ:: Wiley; 2012. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the cost of a 4-ounce serving of cooked turkey without skin, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the yield factor**: 
   - One pound of turkey as purchased yields 0.35 pounds of cooked turkey without skin.

2. **Calculate the cost per pound of cooked turkey**:
   - The cost of the turkey breast is $1.19 per pound.
   - Since only 0.35 pounds of cooked turkey is obtained from 1 pound of raw turkey, the cost per pound of cooked turkey is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound of cooked turkey} = \frac{\$1.19}{0.35}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{1.19}{0.35} \approx 3.40
     \]
   - So, the cost per pound of cooked turkey is approximately $3.40.

3. **Convert the serving size to pounds**:
   - A 4-ounce serving is equivalent to:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per pound}} = 0.25 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of a 4-ounce (0.25 pound) serving**:
   - The cost of a 0.25 pound serving is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of 0.25 pounds} = 0.25 \times 3.40 = 0.85
     \]

Therefore, the cost of a 4-ounce serving of cooked turkey without skin is **$0.85**.

The correct answer is:
A. $0.85

976. How many 5-oz servings are in a 5-gallon tub of ice cream?
A. 25 B. 25.6 C. 100 D. 128 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: 5 gal * 128 oz/gal = 640 oz divided by 5 oz = 128 servings

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 8th ed. New York:: Pearson; 2013:: 194 

GPT Response: 

To determine how many 5-ounce servings are in a 5-gallon tub of ice cream, we need to convert gallons to ounces and then divide by the serving size.

1 gallon is equal to 128 ounces. Therefore, 5 gallons is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 128 \text{ ounces/gallon} = 640 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we divide the total number of ounces by the serving size:
\[ \frac{640 \text{ ounces}}{5 \text{ ounces/serving}} = 128 \text{ servings} \]

So, the number of 5-ounce servings in a 5-gallon tub of ice cream is:
\[ \boxed{128} \]


1043. A cafeteria seats 100 customers. Lunch runs from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Turnover is two customers per hour. How many customers can be served during that time?
A. 200 B. 300 C. 400 D. 500 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: 100 seats × 2 per hour = 200 customers per hour × 2 hour of lunch = 400 customers

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 8th ed. New York:: Pearson; 2013 

GPT Response: 

To determine how many customers can be served during the lunch period, we need to consider the seating capacity, the duration of the lunch period, and the turnover rate.

1. **Seating Capacity**: The cafeteria seats 100 customers.
2. **Lunch Duration**: Lunch runs from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, which is 2 hours.
3. **Turnover Rate**: The turnover rate is two customers per hour.

First, let's calculate the total number of turnovers during the lunch period. Since the turnover rate is two customers per hour, and the lunch period is 2 hours long, the total number of turnovers is:
\[ 2 \text{ turnovers/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ turnovers} \]

Each turnover means that the entire seating capacity is replaced with new customers. Therefore, the total number of customers served is:
\[ \text{Seating Capacity} \times \text{Total Turnovers} = 100 \text{ customers} \times 4 = 400 \text{ customers} \]

So, the cafeteria can serve 400 customers during the lunch period.

The correct answer is:
C. 400

Labor turnover is calculated by dividing the number of employees who left by the average number of employees, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

In this case, 7 employees left out of a department of 52.

Labor turnover = (Number of employees who left / Total number of employees) * 100
Labor turnover = (7 / 52) * 100

Let's do the calculation:

7 / 52 ≈ 0.1346

0.1346 * 100 ≈ 13.46%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the labor turnover is approximately 13%.

So, the correct answer is:
D. 13%


10. Increasing the amount of sugar in a recipe will have which of the following effects on gluten development and the mixing process?
A. Speed gluten development and require more manipulation B. Slow gluten development and require more manipulation C. Speed gluten development and require less manipulation D. Slow gluten development and require less manipulation 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: When sugar is added to a dough or batter mixture, the sugar will compete with the starch for the water in the dough or batter. Reducing the amount of available water will slow gluten development and will increase mixing (manipulation) times for the dough or batter.

References: McWilliams M. Foods:: Experimental Perspectives. 8th ed. New York City, NY:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

B. Slow gluten development and require more manipulation

Increasing the amount of sugar in a recipe can slow down gluten development. Sugar competes with the proteins in flour for water, which is necessary for gluten formation. As a result, the gluten network forms more slowly, and you may need to mix or knead the dough more to achieve the desired texture.


244. A recipe requires 2 lb of cleaned, sliced strawberries. The yield from whole strawberries is 91%. At a minimum, how many pounds of strawberries need to be ordered?
A. 1.82 B. 2.20 C. 2.91 D. 4.40 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: EP/Yield = AP
2.0 ÷ 0.91 = 2.20 lb (rounded to nearest 100th)

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

To determine the minimum number of pounds of whole strawberries needed to yield 2 pounds of cleaned, sliced strawberries, you can use the yield percentage. The yield percentage is 91%, which means that 91% of the weight of the whole strawberries will be usable after cleaning and slicing.

Here's the calculation:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of whole strawberries needed.
2. The yield percentage is 91%, or 0.91 in decimal form.
3. The equation to find \( x \) is:
   \[
   0.91 \times x = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{0.91}
   \]

5. Calculate the value:
   \[
   x \approx 2.20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, at a minimum, you need to order approximately 2.20 pounds of whole strawberries.

The correct answer is:
B. 2.20

298. Which inventory record is usually taken at the end of the month by counting and recording products in stock in all storage areas?
A. Physical B. Perpetual C. Continual D. Periodic 

Difficulty Level: Moderate

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: A physical inventory involves actually counting all items in stock. A perpetual inventory involves recording all purchases and issues so that how much of a given item is in stock at any time is always known. Continual and periodic are not types of inventory records.

References: Gregoire MB, Spears MC. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:: Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

D. Periodic

A periodic inventory record is typically taken at the end of a specific period, such as the end of the month, by physically counting and recording the products in stock in all storage areas. This method contrasts with perpetual inventory systems, which continuously track inventory levels in real-time.


361. Which of the following involves holding others accountable to perform a required task?
A. Capability B. Responsibility C. Authority D. Autonomy 

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: Authority is delegation from the top level to lower levels of management, and holding others accountable to complete a task because of their position in the organization is a form of authority. Responsibility is the obligation to perform an assigned activity, which cannot be delegated. Autonomy is the capacity to self-govern. Capability is the mental or physical ability to perform a task.

References: Gregoire MB. Foodservice Organizations:: A Managerial and Systems Approach. 9th ed. Pearson; 2016. 

GPT Response: 

B. Responsibility

Responsibility involves holding others accountable to perform a required task. It refers to the obligation to complete a task or duty and being answerable for the outcomes.


485. In a PES statement, what is the phrase that links signs and symptoms to etiology?
A. "Because of" B. "Related to" C. "As a result of" D. "As evidenced by" 

Difficulty Level: Easy

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: The format for each nutrition diagnosis, or PES, statement is problem (P), etiology (E), signs and symptoms (S).

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. Communicating the Nutrition Diagnosis or Problem Statement. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

B. "Related to"

In a PES (Problem, Etiology, Signs/Symptoms) statement, the phrase "related to" is used to link the signs and symptoms to the etiology. The structure of a PES statement is typically:

- **Problem** (P) related to **Etiology** (E) as evidenced by **Signs/Symptoms** (S).

For example: "Impaired skin integrity related to prolonged immobility as evidenced by a pressure ulcer on the sacrum."


864. A pregnant client met with the RDN several times during the 1st trimester to manage nausea. That client is now in the third trimester and feels healthy and well.  What should the RDN do now?
A. Discontinue this episode of care B. Recommend bloodwork to check iron status C. Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments D. Transition care to another clinician to identify other potential problems 

Difficulty Level: Difficult

Correct Answer: A

Explanation: When patient goals are met, the RDN should discontinue the episode of care.

References: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. eNCPT. NCP Step 3:: Nutrition Intervention. Accessed November 7, 2023. Available at::  

GPT Response: 

Given that the client is now in the third trimester and feels healthy and well, the RDN should consider the ongoing needs of the client during this critical period of pregnancy. Here are the considerations for each option:

A. **Discontinue this episode of care**: This might not be the best option as the third trimester is a crucial period for both the mother and the developing baby. Nutritional needs and potential issues should still be monitored.

B. **Recommend bloodwork to check iron status**: This is a reasonable option as iron deficiency is common during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. However, this action alone does not address the need for ongoing nutritional support.

C. **Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments**: This is a proactive approach that ensures the client continues to receive support and monitoring throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. It allows the RDN to address any new issues that may arise and ensure the client maintains optimal nutrition.

D. **Transition care to another clinician to identify other potential problems**: This might be unnecessary if the client is currently feeling well and there are no indications of other issues. Continuity of care with the same RDN might be more beneficial.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate action would likely be:

**C. Schedule additional monthly follow-up appointments**

This ensures that the client continues to receive professional support and monitoring, which is important for both maternal and fetal health during the third trimester.


1006. Improper food cooling methods can result in foodborne illness. Which of the following is the recommended time frame for cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF?

Difficulty Level: Expert

Correct Answer: D

Explanation: Cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF should be done within 4 hours. Cooling foods from 140ºF to 70ºF should be completed within 2 hours. Proper food cooling techniques include use of shallow pans to reduce and divide the food, stainless steel storage containers to transfer heat from the food, and ice cubes. 

References: National Restaurant Association. Servsafe manager. Chicago, IL:: NRA Educational Foundation; 2014:: 6.16. 

GPT Response: 

The recommended time frame for cooling foods from 70ºF to 41ºF is:

D. 4 hours

According to food safety guidelines, foods should be cooled from 135ºF to 70ºF within 2 hours, and then from 70ºF to 41ºF or lower within an additional 4 hours. This helps to minimize the time that food spends in the temperature danger zone (40ºF to 140ºF), where bacteria can grow rapidly.
