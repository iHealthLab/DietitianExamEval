Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:

<answer>A. Randomized controlled trial</answer>

The passage indicates that randomized controlled trials provide the strongest evidence for causality and are considered the "accepted standard for studies of nutrient consumption in relation to human health". It states that randomized trials allow for testing of small effects "that are beyond the ability of observational studies to detect reliably" and achieve a degree of control over confounding factors "that is simply not possible with any observational design strategy". The other options listed (qualitative survey, case-control, and cohort studies) are all observational study designs that cannot prove causation.

3. Canned corn has more sodium and less potassium than fresh corn. This is the result of
A. processing. B. enrichment. C. fortification. D. additives. 
[' chloride added in processing,\ninclude luncheon meats and hot dogs (0.55 g/ounce), canned veg-\netables (0.23 g/one-half cup), processed cheese (0.35 g/slice), and\npotato chips (0.28 g/oz.). Most breads, baked goods, and breakfast\ncereals  contain  about  0.15  to  0.33  g  of  sodium  per  serving.  For\nexample, a medium (57 g) bagel has 0.30 g of sodium, a serving of\ncornflakes (21 g) has 0.15 g of sodium, and one slice of bread (28\ng) has 0.16 g of sodium.\n\nSodium  chloride  and  other  sodium-containing  food  additives\n(such  as  those  mentioned  previously)  are  also  present  in  condi-\nments,  such  as  Worcestershire  sauce,  soy  sauce,  ketchup,  onion\nsalt, garlic salt, sea salt, and bouillon cubes, usually to enhance the\nflavor  of  foods.\n\nWhile various forms of sodium are often added during food pro-\ncessing  to  improve  flavor,  many  sodium-containing  additives  also\nhave functional roles (Marsden, 1980). Sodium chloride added to\nyeast  bread  is  essential  for  dough  to  rise  and  it  helps  control  the\ngrowth  of  undesirable  bacteria  and  molds.  It  also  functions  as  a\ndough  conditioner  to  strengthen  the  protein  in  dough  (gluten),\nwhich  allows  it  to  hold  air  and  not  collapse.  Salt  is  also  added  to\nmany  frozen  foods  to  preserve  texture  (Crocco,  1982).  Other  so-\ndium additives, such as sodium bicarbonate and sodium aluminum\nphosphate, are used as leavening agents in nonyeast breads.\n\nSodium chloride decreases the water activity of foods, thus help-\ning  to  control  the  growth  of  pathogenic  bacteria  (Jay,  1996).  So-\ndium chloride is thus used as a preservative in meats and is neces-\nsary  to  make  fermented  products  (e.g.,  pickles)  (Niven,  1980;\nPearson and Wolzak, 1982). A U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nguidance to the seafood industry for the control of microbiological\nhazards,  The  Seafood  HACCP  Guide,  recommends  the  use  of  a  3.5\npercent sodium chloride solution for the control of the pathogen\nClostridium  botulinum  in  smoked  fish  (CFSAN,  2001).  Many  other\nfood  additives  containing  sodium,  such  as  sodium  benzoate  and\nsodium  bisulfate,  function  as  preservatives  in  processed  foods  to\nextend  shelf-life  and  control  microbiological  growth  (IOM,  2003;\nNiven, 1980).\n\nOnly about 12 percent of the total sodium chloride consumed is\nnaturally  occurring  (Mat,

One study reported an increased risk of hyper-\ntension in adult offspring of rats fed either a low-sodium or high-sodium \ndiet during pregnancy and lactation (Koleganova et al., 2011). To clarify \nthe  long-term  effects  of  potassium  and  sodium  exposure,  future  research \nwould accomplish the following:\n\n•  Evaluate  the  first-  and  second-generation  effects  of  high  and  low \npotassium  and  sodium  intakes  of  both  the  mother  and  father  in \norder to identify optimal intakes of these nutrients during repro-\nductive  stages  of  life  and  characterize  the  variability  of  risk  for \nchronic disease in the population. \n\nExplore Opportunities in the Food Supply\n\nReducing Sodium\n\nSodium (in the form of salt and other sodium-containing compounds) \nis added to foods for reasons related to food safety, functionality, and taste. \nMaking lower-sodium foods with high consumer acceptability is critical to \nreducing population-wide sodium intake, but there are conflicting data on \nhow it is best accomplished (Israr et al., 2016). A prior Institute of Medi-\ncine committee explored food technology considerations and strategies for \nreducing  sodium  in  the  food  supply  in  greater  detail  (IOM,  2010);  these \ntopics are discussed here only briefly.\n\nA  number  of  strategies  have  been  implemented  to  enhance  salt  taste \nperception in reduced-sodium products, including use of different forms of \nsalt crystals and addition of certain food additives that either impart salty \ntaste without sodium or enhance the perception of salty taste. For example, \nhollow salt crystals that are less dense than regular crystals dissolve faster \nupon  consumption  and  increase  sodium  perception.  These  crystals  are \nuseful only in dry surface applications (e.g., potato chips) because if they \ndissolve, they lose the advantage of their lower sodium density. Potassium \nchloride may be used to provide salt taste in lower-sodium products, but \nthis ingredient presents challenges for individuals who have health condi-\ntions that reduce clearance of potassium from the blood. It can also have \na bitter and metallic taste, but these off flavors can be decreased by adding \nflavor modifiers or by blending it with sodium chloride. A flavor enhancer \nto help reduce sodium is free glutamate, used mainly in the form of
Based on the information provided, the most appropriate answer is:

<answer>A. processing</answer>

The passage indicates that sodium chloride and other sodium-containing additives are often added during food processing to improve flavor, preserve texture, act as leavening agents, and control microbial growth. This processing is what leads to canned vegetables having more sodium than fresh vegetables. Additionally, the processing likely removes some potassium from the corn, resulting in less potassium compared to fresh corn.

5. Identify the independent variable in an investigation of the impact of differing levels of vitamin D intake on hemoglobin A1c values among postmenopausal women with diabetes.
A. Vitamin D intake B. Postmenopausal women C. Diabetes status D. Hemoglobin A1c values 
['or  polymorphisms  in  the  Vdr  gene  suggest  that  single \nnucleotide  polymorphisms  identified  in  individuals  with  type  1  diabetes \ncould  negatively  modulate  calcitriol  synthesis  and  thereby  play  a  detri-\nmental role in autoimmune response and subsequent manifestation of the \ndisease (Israni et al., 2009).\n\nDiabetes (type 1)  Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease resulting from loss \nof β-cell function in the pancreas. The disease is characterized by dimin-\nished  or  absent  insulin  production  and  loss  of  control  of  blood  glucose. \nEmerging  evidence  for  an  association  between  low  vitamin  D  status  and \nincreased  risk  for  type  1  diabetes  comes  from  experimental  animal,  eco-\nlogical,  and  observational  studies;  however,  no  intervention  trials  using \nsupplemental vitamin D (not analogues) were identified to provide causal \nsupport for a relationship.\n\nBiological  plausibility  Experimental  animal,  ecological,  and  observa-\ntional evidence support a relationship between vitamin D status and risk for \ntype 1 diabetes, although treatment protocols and dosages vary. Ecological \nevidence has suggested a link between type 1 diabetes risk and limited ery-\nthemal UVB exposure in Newfoundland (Sloka et al., 2009, 2010). Mohr \net al. (2008) plotted incidence rates for type 1 diabetes by latitude in an \necologic study comparing geographical distribution, estimated UVB expo-\nsure and disease incidence and, using a polynomial analysis to best fit the \ndata points, determined that the incidence of type 1 diabetes was greater \nat higher latitudes.\n\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.

However,  type  1  diabetes was not prevented \nwhen NOD mice were treated with a supraphysiological dose of vitamin D, \nbeginning from conception and continuing to 10 weeks of age (Hawa et al., \n2004).  Additionally,  in  a  study  in  which  NOD  mice  were  cross  bred  with \nmice null for the Vdr gene, the rate of disease presentation did not differ \nfr,

Without  further  analysis,  however,  it  is  not  pos-\nsible to determine whether the increase in blood pressure was related to \n25OHD levels in blood. A trial in India evaluated the effect of short-term \nvitamin  D  supplementation  on  homeostasis  model  assessment  and  oral \nglucose  insulin  sensitivity  in  healthy,  centrally  obese  men  (Nagpal  et  al., \n2009). In an intention-to-treat analysis, the difference was not significant. \nOverall, higher waist-to-hip ratios and lower baseline serum 25OHD levels \nwere significant predictors of improvement in oral glucose insulin sensitiv-\nity.

Although the findings of this study \nare in agreement with a previous secondary analysis of data from the NHS \ncohort (see below: Pittas et al., 2006), the study is limited by the small num-\nber of outcomes measured compared with the total cohort; thus, an unin-\ntended bias cannot be ruled out. In addition, the study was designed for \nskeletal outcomes as the primary analysis. When the totality of the evidence \nwas considered, the negative findings from the clinical trials for an effect \nof vitamin D or calcium on risk for type 2 diabetes together with the lack of \nsignificant evidence from either the AHRQ reviews or the meta-analysis by \nPittas et al. (2007b) compelled the committee to conclude that there was \nnot sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship.\n\nObservational Studies\n\nLow serum 25OHD levels have been implicated in metabolic syndrome, \n\nabdominal o,
  'besity, and hyperglycemia.\n\nIn  a  prospective  cohort  analysis  of  data  from  NHS,  women  were  fol-\nlowed for 20 years to examine associations between vitamin D and calcium \nintake and risk for type 2 diabetes (Pittas et al., 2006). A significant inverse \nassociation was found between total vitamin D intake and calcium intake \nand risk for type 2 diabetes. A separate analysis of the association between \nrisk  for  type  2  diabetes  and  dairy  food  consumption  found  that  women \nwho consumed three or more dairy servings per day were at lower risk com-\npared with those who consumed less than one dairy serving per day. These \nfindings suggest that risk for type 2 diabetes is associated with vitamin D or \ndairy food intake. A small cohort study in obese and overweight individuals \nfound that in addition to a significant inverse association between serum \n25OHD level and weight and waist circumference there was a weak inverse \nrelationship with hemoglobin A1c. However, no association between serum \n25OHD level and any other indicators of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syn-\ndrome were observed (McGill et al., 2008).\n\nIn other observational evidence reviewed, a cross–sectional survey of \nPolynesian  and  white  adult  populations  in  New  Zealand  found  a  signifi-\ncantly lower serum 25OHD level in subjects with newly diagnosed diabe-\ntes and impaired glucose tolerance compared with controls. In addition, \namong  the  control  groups,  the  native  New  Zealand  populations  (Maori \nand Pacific Islanders) were found to have significantly lower serum 25OHD \nlevels compared with Europeans. The authors speculated that the low se-\nrum 25OHD level in the native populations explained, in part, the higher \nprevalence  of  diabetes  in  those  groups  (Scragg  et  al.,  1995).  Isaia  et  al. \n(2001),  in  a  cross–sectional  study  in  Italy,  found  that  postmenopausal \nwomen diagnosed with type 2 diabetes had significantly higher body mass \nindexes (BMIs), lower activity scores, higher prevalence of serum 25OHD \n\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.

The inhibition of iron absorption from added iron\nis related to the level of phytate in a food (Brune et al., 1992; Cook\net al., 1997). The absorption of iron was shown to increase four- to\nfive-fold when the phytic acid concentration was reduced from 4.9\nto 8.4 mg/g, to less than 0.1 mg/g in soy protein isolate (Hurrell et\nal., 1992). Genetically modified, low-phytic acid strains of maize have\nbeen  developed.  Iron  absorption  with  consumption  of  low-phytic\nacid strains was 49 percent greater than with consumption of wild\ntype strains of maize (Mendoza et al., 1998). Still, the overall avail-\nability  of  iron  remained  quite  low  and  generally  under  8  percent,\neven for subjects with marginal iron status.

Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:

<answer>B. minerals.</answer>

The passage mentions that phytates and oxalates can interfere with the absorption of minerals, specifically calcium. It states that "Higher intakes [of phytate] are associated with higher urinary phytate excretion, which results in reduced calcium availability to bind with oxalate and/or phosphorus in urine." Similarly for oxalates, it notes that high intake "unopposed by appropriate calcium and/or magnesium ingestion" can result in "excessive oxalate absorption." This indicates that phytates and oxalates interfere with mineral absorption, particularly calcium.

Based on \nthis research and USDA's temperature requirement during transport, FDA implemented \nregulations that establish a maximum ambient air temperature of 7ºC (45ºF) for eggs \nstored and displayed at retail establishments. Amended Federal regulations 21 CFR \nPart 115.50 issued on December 5, 2000 and became effective on June 4, 2001.  \n\nAlthough Congress did not expressly preempt State law in this area, FDA found \npreemption is needed because State and local laws that are less stringent than the \nFederal requirements will not support the important public health goals of these \nregulations. FDA does not believe that preemption of State and local refrigeration and \n\nAnnex 3 - 120 \n\n \n\x0cFDA Food Code 2022            Annex 3.

Accordingly, the preemptive \neffect of this rule is limited to State or local requirements that are not as stringent as the \nrequirements of these regulations; requirements that are the same as or more stringent \nthan FDA's requirements remain in effect.  \n\nHistorical Record of Cold Holding Temperature Provisions \n\nThe 1976 Food Service Sanitation Manual recommended 45°F as the cold holding \ntemperature. Based on the available science at the time, the 1993 Food Code lowered \nthe cold holding temperature to 41°F. \n\nHowever, stakeholders raised concerns that many of the refrigerators currently in place \nin food establishments would not be capable of maintaining food at that temperature. \nThere was also concern that most of the open-top buffet and food prep table-type units \nbeing built at the time could not reliably maintain food at 41°F or less. Industry pointed \nout that operators needed to recover investments in new refrigeration equipment \npurchased just before or after a state adopted the 41°F provision. \n\nConsequently, the Conference of Food Protection (CFP) recommended the 1997 Food \nCode incorporate the option of having a 5-year phase-in period for the 41°F requirement \nto allow for,

Therefore, eggs \ntreated by ionizing radiation process alone must be held under refrigeration, as it cannot \nbe guaranteed that Salmonella Enteritidis will be eliminated in all treated eggs. \nFurther, irradiated eggs must be labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 179.26 Ionizing \nradiation for the treatment of food.  \n\nHard-boiled eggs with shell intact may be cooled in ambient air and are not considered \nto be a time/temperature control for safety food after cooling. Hard-boiled eggs may be \ncooled in drinking water but are considered to be a time/temperature control for safety \nfood after cooling because pathogens, which may be present in the water, may pass \nthrough the egg shell during cooling.  \n\nSalmonella Enteritidis has been shown to have an extended lag phase in shell eggs \ndue to inhibitory characteristics of the albumen. Research indicates that the organisms \nare physically located near the exterior of the yolk membrane, in contact with the \nbacteriostatic components. Growth does not appear until the yolk membrane is \nweakened by age or physically breached and the yolk nutrients, such as iron, become \navailable to the organisms.  \n\nFederal regulations effective August 27, 1999, require shell eggs to be transported and \ndistributed under refrigeration at an ambient temperature not to exceed 45°F. Packed \nshell eggs must be labeled indicating that refrigeration is required.

With the newly established \nFederal requirement for eggs to be in an ambient storage and transportation \ntemperature of 45°F, and with refrigeration of eggs at retail as described above, the \noverall time that eggs are stored at temperatures that allow the growth of Salmonella \nspp. should be shortened. Additionally, this requirement negates the need to "cool" shell \neggs upon receipt, although food establishment operators should maximize the \ncirculation of cooled air in refrigeration units by separating flats, cases, and multiple \ncartons of eggs.   \n\nCFSAN/FSIS Joint Position Paper on Cooling \n\nThe processing of most ready-to-eat products includes a heat treatment or cooking step \nto eliminate pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.

Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:

Increasing sugar in a recipe slows down gluten development, as sugar competes with flour for water. This makes the dough stickier and requires more mixing/kneading (manipulation) to properly develop the gluten.

<answer>B. encourages the client to choose which foods to eat</answer>

This option best aligns with honoring client autonomy in motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewing emphasizes allowing the client to be the expert on themselves and make their own decisions, rather than the practitioner dictating what they should do. Encouraging the client to choose which foods to eat respects their autonomy and engages them in the decision-making process.

Many physiologic changes that occur with aging affect\nnutritional status and functional status (Moore, 2008).\n\nWith aging, physiological changes may include the following (Pichard, 2004;\nRussell, 1992; Robinson, 2001; Harris, 2004):\n\nEnergy needs decrease because of a decreased basal metabolic rate\nassociated with diminished lean body mass of 2% to 5% per decade.\nThere is a decrease in immune function.\nHearing loss, increased chronic tinnitus, presbyc,
  'usis, and reduced auditory\nbrainstem response contribute to 50% of those older than age 75 suffering\nfrom some degree of hearing loss (Johnson, 2004; NIDCD, 2012).\nIncreases in thresholds of taste require a higher-concentration flavor\ncomponent necessary for recognition of flavor.\nThere is a reduced number of acinar cells of salivary glands; however, it is\nunclear if lessened salivary function is caused by aging or other factors\nsuch as medications or disease.\nDelayed gastric emptying is possible.\nReduced gastric acid secretion (achlorhydria) is present. \n\nAtrophic gastritis results in a reduced secretion of gastric acid and\nintrinsic factor that may lead to vitamin B-12 and B-6 deficiency\n(Escott-Stump, 2012).\nAchlorhydria may also result in reduced calcium and zinc absorption.\n\nPancreatic enzyme secretion diminishes.\nGallstone prevalence increases.\nLiver function changes with age: \n\nHepatic clearance of drugs decreases.\nLiver size decreases.\nPortal blood flow decreases.\n\nSmall intestine changes with age are possible: \n\nMucosal surface area may be slightly decreased.\nSome brush border enzymes (lactase, maltase, sucrase-isomaltase)\nmay have decreased activity.\nZinc absorption decreases with age, while endogenous losses are also\nfelt to be lower.\nCalcium absorption decreases with age.\n\nChanges in digestion, absorption, and metabolism influence nutrient\navailability in the older adult.\n\nWith aging, liver values of vitamin A remain stable, which may mean that,\ndespite decreasing dietary intake, absorption of the vitamin increases (Russell,\n1992). Because of epidemiologic evidence linking chronic vitamin A intake\ngreater than the Recommended Dietary Allowance and hip fractures, it is\n\nCopyright 2024 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Older adults may have decreased\nintake of vitamin D and reduced sun exposure. Even if the skin is exposed to\nultraviolet light, it is less able to synthesize vitamin D. Aged intestinal mucosa\nhave a decreased number of vitamin D receptors, and kidneys are less capable\nof converting vitamin D into its active form (Russell, 1992; Robinson, 2001).\n\nIn summary, gastrointestinal function,

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate answer is:

<answer>A. Ability to smell and taste decreases</answer>

The passage mentions several physiological changes associated with aging, including:

- "Increases in thresholds of taste require a higher-concentration flavor component necessary for recognition of flavor."
- "There is a reduced number of acinar cells of salivary glands"
- "Reduced gastric acid secretion (achlorhydria) is present"

These changes are consistent with a decreased ability to smell and taste, which is one of the physiological changes typically associated with aging. The other options are not supported by the information provided or are incorrect (e.g. gastric juice secretion decreases rather than increases with age).

This may be partially attributable to dependence on the reported \nkilocalories  consumed  or  to  the  collection  quality  of  urine  specimens. \nDespite  the  positive  correlation,  the  effect  of  including  both  nutrients  in \nmodels  for  blood  pressure  or  cardiovascular  disease  can  strengthen  the \nassociation  (Cook  et  al.,  1998,  2009).  For  example,  including  negatively \ncorrelated  predictors  with  positive  effect  sizes,  or  positively  correlated \npredictors with opposite effect sizes, can be beneficial in predictive models \n(Demler  et  al.,  2013).  Short-term  measurements  that  include  substantial \nmeasurement error, however, can distort the underlying relationship with \nan  outcome  in  observational  data  (Espeland  et  al.,  2001).  Randomized \ntrials specifically designed to intervene on one or both of these measures, \nhowever, may offer additional insight.\n\nSome studies have reported that consumption of potassium-containing \nsalts  increase  urinary  sodium  excretion  and  that  blood  pressure  is  more \nhighly  correlated  with  the  sodium-to-potassium  ratio  than  to  intake  of \n\nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.

Such  data  were\nconsidered in the DRI process and were given particular attention in the\nabsence of reliable data to directly relate nutrient intake to disease risk in\nfree-living individuals.\n\nObservational Studies\n\nIn comparison to human feeding studies, observational epidemiological\nstudies are frequently of direct relevance to free-living humans, but they\nlack the controlled setting. Hence, they are useful in establishing evidence\nof an association between the consumption of a nutrient and disease risk,\nbut are limited in their ability to ascribe a causal relationship. A judgment\nof causality may be supported by a consistency of association among studies\nin  diverse  populations  under  various  conditions,  and  it  may  be  strength-\nened  by  the  use  of  laboratory-based  tools  to  measure  exposures  and\nconfounding  factors,  rather  than  other  means  of  data  collection  such  as\npersonal interviews.\n\nIn  recent  years,  rapid  advances  in  laboratory  technology  have  made\npossible  the  increased  use  of  biomarkers  of  exposure,  susceptibility,  and\ndisease outcome in molecular epidemiological research. For example, one\narea  of  great  potential  in  advancing  current  knowledge  of  the  effects  of\ndiet  on  health  is  the  study  of  genetic  markers  of  disease  susceptibility\n(especially polymorphisms in genes that encode metabolizing enzymes) in\nrelation  to  dietary  exposures.  This  development  is  expected  to  provide\nmore  accurate  assessments  of  the  risk  associated  with  different  levels  of\nintake of nutrients and other food constituents.\n\nWhile analytic epidemiological studies (studies that relate exposure to\ndisease outcomes in individuals) have provided convincing evidence of an\nassociative  relationship  between  selected  nondietary  exposures  and  dis-\nease risk, there are a number of other factors that limit study reliability in\nresearch  relating  nutrient  intakes  to  disease  risk  (Sempos  et  al.,  1999).\nFirst, the variation in nutrient intake may be rather limited in the popula-\ntion  selected  for  study.

The salt also helps decrease \nwater activity, thereby minimizing spoilage by microorganisms and contributing to \nlong shelf lives. Finally, salt produces desired flavors and enhances perception of \nother flavors in the final product.\n\nOther Forms of Sodium Used in Food Production\n\nIn  addition  to  sodium  chloride,  sodium  in  foods  can  originate  from \nfood ingredients that are in the form of sodium salts. For example, phos-\nphates are commonly added to foods to improve protein solubility, inhibit \nlipid oxidation, alter pH, and control bacterial growth. The most common \nforms of phosphates are sodium pyrophosphate and sodium tripolyphos-\nphates. Sodium lactate and sodium diacetate are commonly added to pre-\ncooked, processed meats along with sodium chloride to reduce or prevent \nthe growth of the food pathogens (Seman et al., 2002). Sodium bicarbonate \nis used in chemically leavened baked goods (e.g., cakes) as a source of car-\nbon dioxide. Sodium caseinate is a water-soluble form of the dairy protein \ncasein. Sodium caseinate is used as a light-scattering agent to form a white \nappearance in products such as nondairy creamers, an emulsifier in salad \ndressing and sauces, and as a water binder in meats. Sodium benzoate and \nsodium  proprionate  are  common  antimicrobial  agents  added  to  foods. \nSodium bisulfite and metabisulfite are added to food to prevent browning. \nNonsodium  salts  (e.g.,  potassium)  are  available  for  most  of  these  food \ningredients, but their use can be limited by lower solubility, higher costs, \nand off flavors.\n\nSource of Sodium in the Diet \n\nSources of Sodium Intake\n\nThe  various  roles  of  sodium  in  the  food  supply  provide  context  for \nunderstanding  the  evidence  on  the  various  sources  of  sodium  intake.

Sodium hypochlorite is listed in 21 CFR \n173.315 for use in washing fruits and vegetables at levels not exceeding the minimum \namount required to accomplish the intended technical effect. FDA has no objection to \nthe use of calcium hypochlorite in the place of sodium hypochlorite under 21 CFR \n173.315. \n\nOn December 4, 2012, the FDA amended the food additive regulations to provide for \nthe safe use of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) (CAS No. 25155-30-0) as an \nantimicrobial agent for use in wash water for fruits and vegetables without the \nrequirement of a potable water rinse. 21 CFR Section 173.405 specifically identifies this \nadditive as an antimicrobial agent used in wash water for fruits and vegetables. The \nadditive may be used at a level not to exceed 111 milligrams per kilogram in the wash \nwater. Fruits and vegetables treated by the additive do not require a potable water rinse. \nUse of this additive is limited to use in commissaries, cafeterias, restaurants, retail food \nestablishments, nonprofit food establishments and other food service operations in \nwhich food is prepared for or served directly to the consumer. To ensure safe use of the \nadditive, refer to the label or labeling of the additive and/or antimicrobial pesticide \ncontainer for adequate directions. Information on the label is required in accordance to \nprovisions within 21 CFR 173.405 and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. \nAlthough the petitioned use of SDBS is regulated under Section 409 of the FD & C Act \nas a food additive, this intended use of SDBS may nevertheless be subject to regulation \nas a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).  \nEPA requirements pertain to EPA re,

Most breads, baked goods, and breakfast\ncereals  contain  about  0.15  to  0.33  g  of  sodium  per  serving.  For\nexample, a medium (57 g) bagel has 0.30 g of sodium, a serving of\ncornflakes (21 g) has 0.15 g of sodium, and one slice of bread (28\ng) has 0.16 g of sodium.\n\nSodium  chloride  and  other  sodium-containing  food  additives\n(such  as  those  mentioned  previously)  are  also  present  in  condi-\nments,  such  as  Worcestershire  sauce,  soy  sauce,  ketchup,  onion\nsalt, garlic salt, sea salt, and bouillon cubes, usually to enhance the\nflavor  of  foods.\n\nWhile various forms of sodium are often added during food pro-\ncessing  to  improve  flavor,  many  sodium-containing  additives  also\nhave functional roles (Marsden, 1980). Sodium chloride added to\nyeast  bread  is  essential  for  dough  to  rise  and  it  helps  control  the\ngrowth  of  undesirable  bacteria  and  molds.  It  also  functions  as  a\ndough  conditioner  to  strengthen  the  protein  in  dough  (gluten),\nwhich  allows  it  to  hold  air  and  not  collapse.  Salt  is  also  added  to\nmany  frozen  foods  to  preserve  texture  (Crocco,  1982).  Other  so-\ndium additives, such as sodium bicarbonate and sodium aluminum\nphosphate, are used as leavening agents in nonyeast breads.\n\nSodium chloride decreases the water activity of foods, thus help-\ning  to  control  the  growth  of  pathogenic  bacteria  (Jay,  1996).  So-\ndium chloride is thus used as a preservative in meats and is neces-\nsary  to  make  fermented  products  (e.g.,  pickles)  (Niven,  1980;\nPearson and Wolzak, 1982). A U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nguidance to the seafood industry for the control of microbiological\nhazards,  The  Seafood  HACCP  Guide,  recommends  the  use  of  a  3.5\npercent sodium chloride solution for the control of the pathogen\nClostridium  botulinum  in  smoked  fish  (CFSAN,  2001).  Many  other\nfood  additives  containing  sodium,  such  as  sodium  benzoate  and\nsodium  bisulfate,  function  as  preservatives  in  processed  foods  to\nextend  shelf-life  and  control  microbiological  growth  (IOM,  2003;\nNiven, 1980).\n\nOnly about 12 percent of the total sodium chloride consumed is\nnaturally  occurring  (Mat
Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:

<answer>A. Acidic</answer>

The passage mentions that sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is used in chemically leavened baked goods as a source of carbon dioxide. Baking soda reacts with acidic ingredients in batters to produce carbon dioxide gas, which causes the batter to rise. Therefore, baking soda is typically used when a batter contains acidic ingredients.
